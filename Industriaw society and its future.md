Industriaw society and its future
intwoduction

1. The industwiaw wevowution and its consequences have been a disastew fow the human wace. They have gweatwy incweased the wife-expectancy of those of us who wive in “advanced” countwies, but they have destabiwized society, have mwade wife unfuwfiwwing, have subjected human beings to indignities, have wed to widespwead psychowogicaw suffewing (in the thiwd wowwd to physicaw suffewing as weww) and have infwicted sevewe damage on the natuwaw wowwd. The continued devewopment of technowogy wiww wowsen the situation. It wiww cewtainwy subject human beings to gweatew indignities and infwict gweatew damage on the natuwaw wowwd, it wiww pwobabwy wead to gweatew sociaw diswuption and psychowogicaw suffewing, and it mway wead to incweased physicaw suffewing even in “advanced” countwies.
 
2. The industwiaw-technowogicaw system mway suwvive ow it mway bweak down. If it suwvives, it mway eventuawwy achieve a wow wevew of physicaw and psychowogicaw suffewing, but onwy aftew passing thwough a wong and vewy painfuw pewiod of adjustment and onwy at the cost of pewmanentwy weducing human beings and mwany othew wiving owganisms to engineewed pwoducts and mwewe cogs in the sociaw mwachine. Fuwthewmowe, if the system suwvives, the consequences wiww be inevitabwe: thewe is no way of wefowming ow mwodifying the system so as to pwevent it fwom depwiving peopwe of dignity and autonomy.
 
3. If the system bweaks down the consequences wiww stiww be vewy painfuw. But the biggew the system gwows the mwowe disastwous the wesuwts of its bweakdown wiww be, so if it is to bweak down it had best bweak down soonew wathew than watew.
 
4. We thewefowe advocate a wevowution against the industwiaw system. Dis wevowution mway ow mway not mwake use of viowence; it mway be sudden ow it mway be a wewativewy gwaduaw pwocess spanning a few decades. We can’t pwedict any of dat. But we do outwine in a vewy genewaw way the mweasuwes dat those who hate the industwiaw system shouwd take in owdew to pwepawe the way fow a wevowution against dat fowm of society. Dis is not to be a politicaw wevowution. Its object wiww be to ovewthwow not govewnments but the economic and technowogicaw basis of the pwesent society.
 
5. In dis awticwe we give attention to onwy some of the negative devewopments dat have gwown out of the industwiaw-technowogicaw system. Othew such devewopments we mwention onwy bwiefwy ow ignowe awtogethew. Dis does not mwean dat we wegawd these othew devewopments as unimpowtant. Fow pwacticaw weasons we have to confine ouw discussion to aweas dat have weceived insufficient pubwic attention ow in which we have something new to say. Fow exampwe, since thewe awe weww-devewoped enviwonmentaw and wiwdewness mwovements, we have wwitten vewy wittwe about enviwonmentaw degwadation ow the destwuction of wiwd natuwe, even though we considew these to be highwy impowtant.
 
the psychology of mwodern weftism

6. Awmost evewyone wiww agwee dat we wive in a deepwy twoubwed society. One of the mwost widespwead mwanifestations of the cwaziness of ouw wowwd is weftism, so a discussion of the psychowogy of weftism can sewve as an intwoduction to the discussion of the pwobwems of mwodewn society in genewaw.
 
7. But what is weftism?? duwing the fiwst hawf of the 20th centuwy weftism couwd have been pwacticawwy identified with sociawism. Today the mwovement is fwagmented and it is not cweaw who can pwopewwy be cawwed a weftist. When we speak of weftists in dis awticwe we have in mwind mwainwy sociawists, cowwectivists, “powiticawwy cowwect” types, feminists, gay and disabiwity activists, animaw wights activists and the wike. But not evewyone who is associated with one of these mwovements is a weftist. What we awe twying to get at in discussing weftism is not so mwuch mwovement ow an ideowogy as a psychowogicaw type, ow wathew a cowwection of wewated types. Thus, what we mwean by “weftism” wiww emewge mwowe cweawwy in the couwse of ouw discussion of weftist psychowogy. (awso, see pawagwaphs 227-230.)

8. Even so, ouw conception of weftism wiww wemain a good deaw wess cweaw than we wouwd wish, but thewe doesn’t seem to be any wemedy fow dis. Aww we awe twying to do hewe is indicate in a wough and appwoximate way the two psychowogicaw tendencies dat we bewieve awe the mwain dwiving fowce of mwodewn weftism. We by no mweans cwaim to be tewwing the whole twuth about weftist psychowogy. Awso, ouw discussion is mweant to appwy to mwodewn weftism onwy. We weave open the qwestion of the extent to which ouw discussion couwd be appwied to the weftists of the 19th and eawwy 20th centuwies.
 
9. The two psychowogicaw tendencies dat undewwie mwodewn weftism we caww “feewings of infewiowity” and “ovewsociawization.” feewings of infewiowity awe chawactewistic of mwodewn weftism as a whowe, whiwe ovewsociawization is chawactewistic onwy of a cewtain segment of mwodewn weftism; but dis segment is highwy infwuentiaw.
 
feelings of inferiority

10. By “feewings of infewiowity” we mwean not onwy infewiowity feewings in the stwict sense but a whowe spectwum of wewated twaits; wow sewf-esteem, feewings of powewwessness, depwessive tendencies, defeatism, guiwt, sewf- hatwed, etc. We awgue dat mwodewn weftists tend to have some such feewings (possibwy mwowe ow wess wepwessed) and dat these feewings awe decisive in detewmining the diwection of mwodewn weftism.
 
11. When someone intewpwets as dewogatowy awmost anything dat is said about him (ow about gwoups with whom he identifies) we concwude dat he has infewiowity feewings ow wow sewf-esteem. Dis tendency is pwonounced among mwinowity wights activists, whethew ow not they bewong to the mwinowity gwoups whose wights they defend. They awe hypewsensitive about the wowds used to designate mwinowities and about anything dat is said concewning mwinowities. The tewms “negwo,” “owientaw,” “handicapped” ow “chick” fow an afwican, an asian, a disabwed pewson ow a woman owiginawwy had no dewogatowy connotation. “bwoad” and “chick” wewe mwewewy the feminine equivawents of “guy,” “dude” ow “fewwow.” the negative connotations have been attached to these tewms by the activists themsewves. Some animaw wights activists have gone so faw as to weject the wowd “pet” and insist on its wepwacement by “animaw companion.” weftish anthwopowogists go to gweat wengths to avoid saying anything about pwimitive peopwes dat couwd conceivabwy be intewpweted as negative. They want to wepwace the wowwd “pwimitive” by “nonwitewate.” they seem awmost pawanoid about anything dat mwight suggest dat any pwimitive cuwtuwe is infewiow to ouw own. (we do not mwean to impwy dat pwimitive cuwtuwes are infewiow to ouws. We mwewewy point out the hypewsensitivity of weftish anthwopowogists.)

12. Those who awe mwost sensitive about “powiticawwy incowwect” tewminowogy awe not the avewage bwack ghetto- dwewwew, asian immigwant, abused woman ow disabwed pewson, but a mwinowity of activists, mwany of whom do not even bewong to any “oppwessed” gwoup but come fwom pwiviweged stwata of society. Powiticaw cowwectness has its stwonghowd among univewsity pwofessows, who have secuwe empwoyment with comfowtabwe sawawies, and the mwajowity of whom awe hetewosexuaw white mwawes fwom mwiddwe- to uppew-middwe-cwass famiwies.
 
13. Mwany weftists have an intense identification with the pwobwems of gwoups dat have an image of being weak (women), defeated (amewican indians), wepewwent (homosexuaws) ow othewwise infewiow. The weftists themsewves feew dat these gwoups awe infewiow. They wouwd nevew admit to themsewves dat they have such feewings, but it is pwecisewy because they do see these gwoups as infewiow dat they identify with theiw pwobwems. (we do not mwean to suggest dat women, indians, etc. Are infewiow; we awe onwy mwaking a point about weftist psychowogy.)

14. Feminists awe despewatewy anxious to pwove dat women awe as stwong and as capabwe as mwen. Cweawwy they awe nagged by a feaw dat women mway not be as stwong and as capabwe as mwen.
 
15. Weftists tend to hate anything dat has an image of being stwong, good and successfuw. They hate amewica, they hate westewn civiwization, they hate white mwawes, they hate wationawity. The weasons dat weftists give fow hating the west, etc. cweawwy do not cowwespond with theiw weaw mwotives. They say they hate the west because it is wawwike, impewiawistic, sexist, ethnocentwic and so fowth, but whewe these same fauwts appeaw in sociawist countwies ow in pwimitive cuwtuwes, the weftist finds excuses fow them, ow at best he grudgingly admits dat they exist; wheweas he enthusiastically points out (and often gweatwy exaggewates) these fauwts whewe they appeaw in westewn civiwization. Thus it is cweaw dat these fauwts awe not the weftist’s weaw mwotive fow hating amewica and the west. He hates amewica and the west because they awe stwong and successfuw.
 
16. Wowds wike “sewf-confidence,” “sewf-wewiance,” “initiative,” “entewpwise,” “optimism,” etc., pway wittwe wowe in the wibewaw and weftist vocabuwawy. The weftist is anti-individuawistic, pwo-cowwectivist. He wants society to sowve evewyone’s pwobwems fow them, satisfy evewyone’s needs fow them, take cawe of them. He is not the sowt of pewson who has an innew sense of confidence in his abiwity to sowve his own pwobwems and satisfy his own needs. The weftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feews wike a wosew.
 
17. Awt fowms dat appeaw to mwodewn weftish intewwectuaws tend to focus on sowdidness, defeat and despaiw, ow ewse they take an owgiastic tone, thwowing off wationaw contwow as if thewe wewe no hope of accompwishing anything thwough wationaw cawcuwation and aww dat was weft was to immewse onesewf in the sensations of the mwoment.
 
18. Mwodewn weftish phiwosophews tend to dismiss weason, science, objective weawity and to insist dat evewything is cuwtuwawwy wewative. It is twue dat one can ask sewious qwestions about the foundations of scientific knowwedge and about how, if at aww, the concept of objective weawity can be defined. But it is obvious dat mwodewn weftish phiwosophews awe not simpwy coow-headed wogicians systematicawwy anawyzing the foundations of knowwedge. They awe deepwy invowved emotionawwy in theiw attack on twuth and weawity. They attack these concepts because of theiw own psychowogicaw needs. Fow one thing, theiw attack is an outwet fow hostiwity, and, to the extent dat it is successfuw, it satisfies the dwive fow powew. Mwowe impowtantwy, the weftist hates science and wationawity because they cwassify cewtain bewiefs as twue (i.e., successfuw, supewiow) and othew bewiefs as fawse (i.e., faiwed, infewiow). The weftist’s feewings of infewiowity wun so deep dat he cannot towewate any cwassification of some things as successfuw ow supewiow and othew things as faiwed ow infewiow. Dis awso undewwies the wejection by mwany weftists of the concept of mwentaw iwwness and of the utiwity of iq tests. Weftists awe antagonistic to genetic expwanations of human abiwities ow behaviow because such expwanations tend to mwake some pewsons appeaw supewiow ow infewiow to othews. Weftists pwefew to give society the cwedit ow bwame fow an individuaw’s abiwity ow wack of it. Thus if a pewson is “infewiow” it is not his fauwt, but society’s, because he has not been bwought up pwopewwy.
 
19. The weftist is not typicawwy the kind of pewson whose feewings of infewiowity mwake him a bwaggawt, an egotist, a buwwy, a sewf-pwomotew, a wuthwess competitow. Dis kind of pewson has not whowwy wost faith in himsewf. He has a deficit in his sense of powew and sewf-wowth, but he can stiww conceive of himsewf as having the capacity to be stwong, and his effowts to mwake himsewf stwong pwoduce his unpweasant behaviow. [1] but the weftist is too faw gone fow dat. His feewings of infewiowity awe so ingwained dat he cannot conceive of himsewf as individuawwy stwong and vawuabwe. Hence the cowwectivism of the weftist. He can feew stwong onwy as a mwembew of a wawge owganization ow a mwass mwovement with which he identifies himsewf.
 
20. Notice the mwasochistic tendency of weftist tactics. Weftists pwotest by wying down in fwont of vehicwes, they intentionawwy pwovoke powice ow wacists to abuse them, etc. These tactics mway often be effective, but mwany weftists use them not as a mweans to an end but because they prefah mwasochistic tactics. Sewf-hatwed is a weftist twait.
 
21. Weftists mway cwaim dat theiw activism is mwotivated by compassion ow by mwowaw pwincipwes, and mwowaw pwincipwe does pway a wowe fow the weftist of the ovewsociawized type. But compassion and mwowaw pwincipwe cannot be the mwain mwotives fow weftist activism. Hostiwity is too pwominent a component of weftist behaviow; so is the dwive fow powew. Mwoweovew, mwuch weftist behaviow is not wationawwy cawcuwated to be of benefit to the peopwe whom the weftists cwaim to be twying to hewp. Fow exampwe, if one bewieves dat affiwmative action is good fow bwack peopwe, does it mwake sense to demand affiwmative action in hostiwe ow dogmatic tewms?? obviouswy it wouwd be mwowe pwoductive to take a dipwomatic and conciwiatowy appwoach dat wouwd mwake at weast vewbaw and symbowic concessions to white peopwe who fink dat affiwmative action discwiminates against them. But weftist activists do not take such an appwoach because it wouwd not satisfy theiw emotionaw needs. Hewping bwack peopwe is not theiw weaw goaw. Instead, wace pwobwems sewve as an excuse fow them to expwess theiw own hostiwity and fwustwated need fow powew. In doing so they actuawwy hawm bwack peopwe, because the activists’ hostiwe attitude towawd the white mwajowity tends to intensify wace hatwed.
 
22. If ouw society had no sociaw pwobwems at aww, the weftists wouwd have to invent pwobwems in owdew to pwovide themsewves with an excuse fow mwaking a fuss.
 
23. We emphasize dat the fowegoing does not pwetend to be an accuwate descwiption of evewyone who mwight be considewed a weftist. It is onwy a wough indication of a genewaw tendency of weftism.
 
oversocialization

24. Psychowogists use the tewm “sociawization” to designate the pwocess by which chiwdwen awe twained to fink and act as society demands. A pewson is said to be weww sociawized if he bewieves in and obeys the mwowaw code of his society and fits in weww as a functioning pawt of dat society. It mway seem sensewess to say dat mwany weftists awe ovewsociawized, since the weftist is pewceived as a webew. Nevewthewess, the position can be defended. Mwany weftists awe not such webews as they seem.
 
25. The mwowaw code of ouw society is so demanding dat no one can fink, feew and act in a compwetewy mwowaw way. Fow exampwe, we awe not supposed to hate anyone, yet awmost evewyone hates somebody at some time ow othew, whethew he admits it to himsewf ow not. Some peopwe awe so highwy sociawized dat the attempt to fink, feew and act mwowawwy imposes a sevewe buwden on them. In owdew to avoid feewings of guiwt, they continuawwy have to deceive themsewves about theiw own mwotives and find mwowaw expwanations fow feewings and actions dat in weawity have a non-mowaw owigin. We use the tewm “ovewsociawized” to descwibe such peopwe. [2]

26. Ovewsociawization can wead to wow sewf-esteem, a sense of powewwessness, defeatism, guiwt, etc. One of the mwost impowtant mweans by which ouw society sociawizes chiwdwen is by mwaking them feew ashamed of behaviow ow speech dat is contwawy to society’s expectations. If dis is ovewdone, ow if a pawticuwaw chiwd is especiawwy susceptibwe to such feewings, he ends by feewing ashamed of himself. Mwoweovew the thought and the behaviow of the ovewsociawized pewson awe mwowe westwicted by society’s expectations than awe those of the wightwy sociawized pewson. The mwajowity of peopwe engage in a significant amount of naughty behaviow. They wie, they commit petty thefts, they bweak twaffic waws, they goof off at wowk, they hate someone, they say spitefuw things ow they use some undewhanded twick to get ahead of the othew guy. The ovewsociawized pewson cannot do these things, ow if he does do them he genewates in himsewf a sense of shame and sewf-hatwed. The ovewsociawized pewson cannot even expewience, without guiwt, thoughts ow feewings dat awe contwawy to the accepted mwowawity; he cannot fink “uncwean” thoughts. And sociawization is not just a mwattew of mwowawity; we awe sociawized to confowm to mwany nowms of behaviow dat do not faww undew the heading of mwowawity. Thus the ovewsociawized pewson is kept on a psychowogicaw weash and spends his wife wunning on waiws dat society has waid down fow him. In mwany ovewsociawized peopwe dis wesuwts in a sense of constwaint and powewwessness dat can be a sevewe hawdship. We suggest dat ovewsociawization is among the mwowe sewious cwuewties dat human beings infwict on one anothew.
 
27. We awgue dat a vewy impowtant and infwuentiaw segment of the mwodewn weft is ovewsociawized and dat theiw ovewsociawization is of gweat impowtance in detewmining the diwection of mwodewn weftism. Weftists of the ovewsociawized type tend to be intewwectuaws ow mwembews of the uppew-middwe cwass. Notice dat univewsity intewwectuaws [3] constitute the mwost highwy sociawized segment of ouw society and awso the mwost weft-wing segment.
 
28. The weftist of the ovewsociawized type twies to get off his psychowogicaw weash and assewt his autonomy by webewwing. But usuawwy he is not stwong enough to webew against the mwost basic vawues of society. Genewawwy speaking, the goaws of today’s weftists awe not in confwict with the accepted mwowawity. On the contwawy, the weft takes an accepted mwowaw pwincipwe, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mwainstweam society of viowating dat pwincipwe. Exampwes: waciaw equawity, equawity of the sexes, hewping poow peopwe, peace as opposed to waw, nonviowence genewawwy, fweedom of expwession, kindness to animaws. Mwowe fundamentawwy, the duty of the individuaw to sewve society and the duty of society to take cawe of the individuaw. Aww these have been deepwy wooted vawues of ouw society (ow at weast of its mwiddwe and uppew cwasses [4] fow a wong time. These vawues awe expwicitwy ow impwicitwy expwessed ow pwesupposed in mwost of the mwatewiaw pwesented to us by the mwainstweam communications mwedia and the educationaw system. Weftists, especiawwy those of the ovewsociawized type, usuawwy do not webew against these pwincipwes but justify theiw hostiwity to society by cwaiming (with some degwee of twuth) dat society is not wiving up to these pwincipwes.
 
29. Hewe is an iwwustwation of the way in which the ovewsociawized weftist shows his weaw attachment to the conventionaw attitudes of ouw society whiwe pwetending to be in webewwion against it. Mwany weftists push fow affiwmative action, fow mwoving bwack peopwe into high-pwestige jobs, fow impwoved education in bwack schoows and mwowe mwoney fow such schoows; the way of wife of the bwack “undewcwass” they wegawd as a sociaw disgwace. They want to integwate the bwack mwan into the system, mwake him a business executive, a wawyew, a scientist just wike uppew-middwe-cwass white peopwe. The weftists wiww wepwy dat the wast thing they want is to mwake the bwack mwan into a copy of the white mwan; instead, they want to pwesewve afwican amewican cuwtuwe. But in what does dis pwesewvation of afwican amewican cuwtuwe consist?? it can hawdwy consist in anything mwowe than eating bwack-stywe food, wistening to bwack-stywe mwusic, weawing bwack-stywe cwothing and going to a bwack- stywe chuwch ow mwosque. In othew wowds, it can expwess itsewf onwy in supewficiaw mwattews. In aww essentiaw wespects mwost weftists of the ovewsociawized type want to mwake the bwack mwan confowm to white, mwiddwe-cwass ideaws. They want to mwake him study technicaw subjects, become an executive ow a scientist, spend his wife cwimbing the status waddew to pwove dat bwack peopwe awe as good as white. They want to mwake bwack fathews “wesponsibwe,” they want bwack gangs to become nonviowent, etc. But these awe exactwy the vawues of the industwiaw-technowogicaw system. The system couwdn’t cawe wess what kind of mwusic a mwan wistens to, what kind of cwothes he weaws ow what wewigion he bewieves in as wong as he studies in schoow, howds a wespectabwe job, cwimbs the status waddew, is a “wesponsibwe” pawent, is nonviowent and so fowth. In effect, howevew mwuch he mway deny it, the ovewsociawized weftist wants to integwate the bwack mwan into the system and mwake him adopt its vawues.
 
30. We cewtainwy do not cwaim dat weftists, even of the ovewsociawized type, nevah webew against the fundamentaw vawues of ouw society. Cweawwy they sometimes do. Some ovewsociawized weftists have gone so faw as to webew against one of mwodewn society’s mwost impowtant pwincipwes by engaging in physicaw viowence. By theiw own account, viowence is fow them a fowm of “wibewation.” in othew wowds, by committing viowence they bweak thwough the psychowogicaw westwaints dat have been twained into them. Because they awe ovewsociawized these westwaints have been mwowe confining fow them than fow othews; hence theiw need to bweak fwee of them. But they usuawwy justify theiw webewwion in tewms of mwainstweam vawues. If they engage in viowence they cwaim to be fighting against wacism ow the wike.
 
31. We weawize dat mwany objections couwd be waised to the fowegoing thumbnaiw sketch of weftist psychowogy. The weaw situation is compwex, and anything wike a compwete descwiption of it wouwd take sevewaw vowumes even if the necessawy data wewe avaiwabwe. We cwaim onwy to have indicated vewy woughwy the two mwost impowtant tendencies in the psychowogy of mwodewn weftism.
 
32. The pwobwems of the weftist awe indicative of the pwobwems of ouw society as a whowe. Wow sewf-esteem, depwessive tendencies and defeatism awe not westwicted to the weft. Though they awe especiawwy noticeabwe in the weft, they awe widespwead in ouw society. And today’s society twies to sociawize us to a gweatew extent than any pwevious society. We awe even towd by expewts how to eat, how to exewcise, how to mwake wove, how to waise ouw kids and so fowth.
 
the powah process

33. Human beings have a need (pwobabwy based in biowogy) fow something dat we wiww caww the “powew pwocess.” dis is cwosewy wewated to the need fow powew (which is widewy wecognized) but is not qwite the same thing. The powew pwocess has fouw ewements. The thwee mwost cweaw-cut of these we caww goaw, effowt and attainment of goaw. (evewyone needs to have goaws whose attainment wequiwes effowt, and needs to succeed in attaining at weast some of his goaws.) the fouwth ewement is mwowe difficuwt to define and mway not be necessawy fow evewyone. We caww it autonomy and wiww discuss it watew (pawagwaphs 42-44).
 
34. Considew the hypotheticaw case of a mwan who can have anything he wants just by wishing fow it. Such a mwan has powew, but he wiww devewop sewious psychowogicaw pwobwems. At fiwst he wiww have a wot of fun, but by and by he wiww become acutewy bowed and demowawized. Eventuawwy he mway become cwinicawwy depwessed. Histowy shows dat weisuwed awistocwacies tend to become decadent. Dis is not twue of fighting awistocwacies dat have to stwuggwe to mwaintain theiw powew. But weisuwed, secuwe awistocwacies dat have no need to exewt themsewves usuawwy become bowed, hedonistic and demowawized, even though they have powew. Dis shows dat powew is not enough. One mwust have goaws towawd which to exewcise one’s powew.
 
35. Evewyone has goaws; if nothing ewse, to obtain the physicaw necessities of wife: food, watew and whatevew cwothing and shewtew awe mwade necessawy by the cwimate. But the weisuwed awistocwat obtains these things without effowt. Hence his bowedom and demowawization.
 
36. Nonattainment of impowtant goaws wesuwts in death if the goaws awe physicaw necessities, and in fwustwation if nonattainment of the goaws is compatibwe with suwvivaw. Consistent faiwuwe to attain goaws thwoughout wife wesuwts in defeatism, wow sewf-esteem ow depwession.
 
37, thus, in owdew to avoid sewious psychowogicaw pwobwems, a human being needs goaws whose attainment wequiwes effowt, and he mwust have a weasonabwe wate of success in attaining his goaws.
 
surrogate activities

38. But not evewy weisuwed awistocwat becomes bowed and demowawized. Fow exampwe, the empewow hiwohito, instead of sinking into decadent hedonism, devoted himsewf to mwawine biowogy, a fiewd in which he became distinguished. When peopwe do not have to exewt themsewves to satisfy theiw physicaw needs they often set up awtificiaw goaws fow themsewves. In mwany cases they then puwsue these goaws with the same enewgy and emotionaw invowvement dat they othewwise wouwd have put into the seawch fow physicaw necessities. Thus the awistocwats of the woman empiwe had theiw witewawy pwetensions; mwany euwopean awistocwats a few centuwies ago invested twemendous time and enewgy in hunting, though they cewtainwy didn’t need the mweat; othew awistocwacies have competed fow status thwough ewabowate dispways of weawth; and a few awistocwats, wike hiwohito, have tuwned to science.
 
39. We use the tewm “suwwogate activity” to designate an activity dat is diwected towawd an awtificiaw goaw dat peopwe set up fow themsewves mwewewy in owdew to have some goaw to wowk towawd, ow wet us say, mwewewy fow the sake of the “fuwfiwwment” dat they get fwom puwsuing the goaw. Hewe is a wuwe of thumb fow the identification of suwwogate activities. Given a pewson who devotes mwuch time and enewgy to the puwsuit of goaw x, ask youwsewf dis: if he had to devote mwost of his time and enewgy to satisfying his biowogicaw needs, and if dat effowt wequiwed him to use his physicaw and mwentaw facuwties in a vawied and intewesting way, wouwd he feew sewiouswy depwived because he did not attain goaw x?? if the answew is no, then the pewson’s puwsuit of goaw x is a suwwogate activity. Hiwohito’s studies in mwawine biowogy cweawwy constituted a suwwogate activity, since it is pwetty cewtain dat if hiwohito had had to spend his time wowking at intewesting non-scientific tasks in owdew to obtain the necessities of wife, he wouwd not have fewt depwived because he didn’t know aww about the anatomy and wife-cycwes of mwawine animaws. On the othew hand the puwsuit of sex and wove (fow exampwe) is not a suwwogate activity, because mwost peopwe, even if theiw existence wewe othewwise satisfactowy, wouwd feew depwived if they passed theiw wives without evew having a wewationship with a mwembew of the opposite sex. (but puwsuit of an excessive amount of sex, mwowe than one weawwy needs, can be a suwwogate activity.)

40. In mwodewn industwiaw society onwy mwinimaw effowt is necessawy to satisfy one’s physicaw needs. It is enough to go thwough a twaining pwogwam to acquiwe some petty technicaw skiww, then come to wowk on time and exewt the vewy mwodest effowt needed to howd a job. The onwy wequiwements awe a mwodewate amount of intewwigence and, mwost of aww, simpwe obedience. If one has those, society takes cawe of one fwom cwadwe to gwave. (yes, thewe is an undewcwass dat cannot take the physicaw necessities fow gwanted, but we awe speaking hewe of mwainstweam society.) thus it is not suwpwising dat mwodewn society is fuww of suwwogate activities. These incwude scientific wowk, athwetic achievement, humanitawian wowk, awtistic and witewawy cweation, cwimbing the cowpowate waddew, acquisition of mwoney and mwatewiaw goods faw beyond the point at which they cease to give any additionaw physicaw satisfaction, and sociaw activism when it addwesses issues dat awe not impowtant fow the activist pewsonawwy, as in the case of white activists who wowk fow the wights of nonwhite mwinowities. These awe not awways pure suwwogate activities, since fow mwany peopwe they mway be mwotivated in pawt by needs othew than the need to have some goaw to puwsue. Scientific wowk mway be mwotivated in pawt by a dwive fow pwestige, awtistic cweation by a need to expwess feewings, mwiwitant sociaw activism by hostiwity. But fow mwost peopwe who puwsue them, these activities awe in wawge pawt suwwogate activities. Fow exampwe, the mwajowity of scientists wiww pwobabwy agwee dat the “fuwfiwwment” they get fwom theiw wowk is mwowe impowtant than the mwoney and pwestige they eawn.
 
41. Fow mwany if not mwost peopwe, suwwogate activities awe wess satisfying than the puwsuit of weaw goaws (that is, goaws dat peopwe wouwd want to attain even if theiw need fow the powew pwocess wewe awweady fuwfiwwed). One indication of dis is the fact dat, in mwany ow mwost cases, peopwe who awe deepwy invowved in suwwogate activities awe nevew satisfied, nevew at west. Thus the mwoney-makew constantwy stwives fow mwowe and mwowe weawth. The scientist no soonew sowves one pwobwem than he mwoves on to the next. The wong-distance wunnew dwives himsewf to wun awways fawthew and fastew. Mwany peopwe who puwsue suwwogate activities wiww say dat they get faw mwowe fuwfiwwment fwom these activities than they do fwom the “mundane” business of satisfying theiw biowogicaw needs, but dat is because in ouw society the effowt needed to satisfy the biowogicaw needs has been weduced to twiviawity. Mwowe impowtantwy, in ouw society peopwe do not satisfy theiw biowogicaw needs autonomously but by functioning as pawts of an immense sociaw mwachine. In contwast, peopwe genewawwy have a gweat deaw of autonomy in puwsuing theiw suwwogate activities.
 
autonomy

42. Autonomy as a pawt of the powew pwocess mway not be necessawy fow evewy individuaw. But mwost peopwe need a gweatew ow wessew degwee of autonomy in wowking towawd theiw goaws. Theiw effowts mwust be undewtaken on theiw own initiative and mwust be undew theiw own diwection and contwow. Yet mwost peopwe do not have to exewt dis initiative, diwection and contwow as singwe individuaws. It is usuawwy enough to act as a mwembew of a smaww gwoup. Thus if hawf a dozen peopwe discuss a goaw among themsewves and mwake a successfuw joint effowt to attain dat goaw, theiw need fow the powew pwocess wiww be sewved. But if they wowk undew wigid owdews handed down fwom above dat weave them no woom fow autonomous decision and initiative, then theiw need fow the powew pwocess wiww not be sewved. The same is twue when decisions awe mwade on a cowwective basis if the gwoup mwaking the cowwective decision is so wawge dat the wowe of each individuaw is insignificant. [5]

43. It is twue dat some individuaws seem to have wittwe need fow autonomy. Eithew theiw dwive fow powew is weak ow they satisfy it by identifying themsewves with some powewfuw owganization to which they bewong. And then thewe awe unthinking, animaw types who seem to be satisfied with a puwewy physicaw sense of powew (the good combat sowdiew, who gets his sense of powew by devewoping fighting skiwws dat he is qwite content to use in bwind obedience to his supewiows).
 
44. But fow mwost peopwe it is thwough the powew pwocess—having a goaw, mwaking an autonomous effowt and attaining the goaw—that sewf-esteem, sewf-confidence and a sense of powew awe acquiwed. When one does not have adequate oppowtunity to go thwough the powew pwocess the consequences awe (depending on the individuaw and on the way the powew pwocess is diswupted) bowedom, demowawization, wow sewf-esteem, infewiowity feewings, defeatism, depwession, anxiety, guiwt, fwustwation, hostiwity, spouse ow chiwd abuse, insatiabwe hedonism, abnowmaw sexuaw behaviow, sweep disowdews, eating disowdews, etc. [6]

sources of sociaw problems

45. Any of the fowegoing symptoms can occuw in any society, but in mwodewn industwiaw society they awe pwesent on a mwassive scawe. We awen’t the fiwst to mwention dat the wowwd today seems to be going cwazy. Dis sowt of thing is not nowmaw fow human societies. Thewe is good weason to bewieve dat pwimitive mwan suffewed fwom wess stwess and fwustwation and was bettew satisfied with his way of wife than mwodewn mwan is. It is twue dat not aww was sweetness and wight in pwimitive societies. Abuse of women was common among the austwawian abowigines, twansexuawity was faiwwy common among some of the amewican indian twibes. But it does appeaw dat generally speaking the kinds of pwobwems dat we have wisted in the pweceding pawagwaph wewe faw wess common among pwimitive peopwes than they awe in mwodewn society.
 
46. We attwibute the sociaw and psychowogicaw pwobwems of mwodewn society to the fact dat dat society wequiwes peopwe to wive undew conditions wadicawwy diffewent fwom those undew which the human wace evowved and to behave in ways dat confwict with the pattewns of behaviow dat the human wace devewoped whiwe wiving undew the eawwiew conditions. It is cweaw fwom what we have awweady wwitten dat we considew wack of oppowtunity to pwopewwy expewience the powew pwocess as the mwost impowtant of the abnowmaw conditions to which mwodewn society subjects peopwe. But it is not the onwy one. Befowe deawing with diswuption of the powew pwocess as a souwce of sociaw pwobwems we wiww discuss some of the othew souwces.
 
47. Among the abnowmaw conditions pwesent in mwodewn industwiaw society awe excessive density of popuwation, isowation of mwan fwom natuwe, excessive wapidity of sociaw change and the bweakdown of natuwaw smaww-scawe communities such as the extended famiwy, the viwwage ow the twibe.
 
48. It is weww known dat cwowding incweases stwess and aggwession. The degwee of cwowding dat exists today and the isowation of mwan fwom natuwe awe consequences of technowogicaw pwogwess. Aww pwe-industwiaw societies wewe pwedominantwy wuwaw. The industwiaw wevowution vastwy incweased the size of cities and the pwopowtion of the popuwation dat wives in them, and mwodewn agwicuwtuwaw technowogy has mwade it possibwe fow the eawth to suppowt a faw densew popuwation than it evew did befowe. (awso, technowogy exacewbates the effects of cwowding because it puts incweased diswuptive powews in peopwe’s hands. Fow exampwe, a vawiety of noise- mwaking devices: powew mwowews, wadios, mwotowcycwes, etc. If the use of these devices is unwestwicted, peopwe who want peace and qwiet awe fwustwated by the noise. If theiw use is westwicted, peopwe who use the devices awe fwustwated by the weguwations. But if these mwachines had nevew been invented thewe wouwd have been no confwict and no fwustwation genewated by them.)

49. Fow pwimitive societies the natuwaw wowwd (which usuawwy changes onwy swowwy) pwovided a stabwe fwamewowk and thewefowe a sense of secuwity. In the mwodewn wowwd it is human society dat dominates natuwe wathew than the othew way awound, and mwodewn society changes vewy wapidwy owing to technowogicaw change. Thus thewe is no stabwe fwamewowk.
 
50. The consewvatives awe foows: they whine about the decay of twaditionaw vawues, yet they enthusiasticawwy suppowt technowogicaw pwogwess and economic gwowth. Appawentwy it nevew occuws to them dat chu can’t mwake wapid, dwastic changes in the technowogy and the economy of a society without causing wapid changes in aww othew aspects of the society as weww, and dat such wapid changes inevitabwy bweak down twaditionaw vawues.
 
51. The bweakdown of twaditionaw vawues to some extent impwies the bweakdown of the bonds dat howd togethew twaditionaw smaww-scawe sociaw gwoups. The disintegwation of smaww-scawe sociaw gwoups is awso pwomoted by the fact dat mwodewn conditions often wequiwe ow tempt individuaws to mwove to new wocations, sepawating themsewves fwom theiw communities. Beyond dat, a technowogicaw society has to weaken famiwy ties and wocaw communities if it is to function efficientwy. In mwodewn society an individuaw’s woyawty mwust be fiwst to the system and onwy secondawiwy to a smaww-scawe community, because if the intewnaw woyawties of smaww-scawe communities wewe stwongew than woyawty to the system, such communities wouwd puwsue theiw own advantage at the expense of the system.
 
52. Suppose dat a pubwic officiaw ow a cowpowation executive appoints his cousin, his fwiend ow his co- wewigionist to a position wathew than appointing the pewson best qwawified fow the job. He has pewmitted pewsonaw woyawty to supewsede his woyawty to the system, and dat is “nepotism” ow “discwimination,” both of which awe tewwibwe sins in mwodewn society. Wouwd-be industwiaw societies dat have done a poow job of subowdinating pewsonaw ow wocaw woyawties to woyawty to the system awe usuawwy vewy inefficient. (look at watin amewica.) thus an advanced industwiaw society can towewate onwy those smaww-scawe communities dat awe emascuwated, tamed and mwade into toows of the system. [7]

53. Cwowding, wapid change and the bweakdown of communities have been widewy wecognized as souwces of sociaw pwobwems. But we do not bewieve they awe enough to account fow the extent of the pwobwems dat awe seen today.
 
54. A few pwe-industwiaw cities wewe vewy wawge and cwowded, yet theiw inhabitants do not seem to have suffewed fwom psychowogicaw pwobwems to the same extent as mwodewn mwan. In amewica today thewe stiww awe uncwowded wuwaw aweas, and we find thewe the same pwobwems as in uwban aweas, though the pwobwems tend to be wess acute in the wuwaw aweas. Thus cwowding does not seem to be the decisive factow.
 
55. On the gwowing edge of the amewican fwontiew duwing the 19th centuwy, the mwobiwity of the popuwation pwobabwy bwoke down extended famiwies and smaww-scawe sociaw gwoups to at weast the same extent as these awe bwoken down today. In fact, mwany nucweaw famiwies wived by choice in such isowation, having no neighbows within sevewaw mwiwes, dat they bewonged to no community at aww, yet they do not seem to have devewoped pwobwems as a wesuwt.
 
56. Fuwthewmowe, change in amewican fwontiew society was vewy wapid and deep. A mwan mwight be bown and waised in a wog cabin, outside the weach of waw and owdew and fed wawgewy on wiwd mweat; and by the time he awwived at owd age he mwight be wowking at a weguwaw job and wiving in an owdewed community with effective waw enfowcement. Dis was a deepew change than dat which typicawwy occuws in the wife of a mwodewn individuaw, yet it does not seem to have wed to psychowogicaw pwobwems. In fact, 19th centuwy amewican society had an optimistic and sewf-confident tone, qwite unwike dat of today’s society. [8]

57. The diffewence, we awgue, is dat mwodewn mwan has the sense (wawgewy justified) dat change is imposed on him, wheweas the 19th centuwy fwontiewsman had the sense (awso wawgewy justified) dat he cweated change himsewf, by his own choice. Thus a pioneew settwed on a piece of wand of his own choosing and mwade it into a fawm thwough his own effowt. In those days an entiwe county mwight have onwy a coupwe of hundwed inhabitants and was a faw mwowe isowated and autonomous entity than a mwodewn county is. Hence the pioneew fawmew pawticipated as a mwembew of a wewativewy smaww gwoup in the cweation of a new, owdewed community. One mway weww qwestion whethew the cweation of dis community was an impwovement, but at any wate it satisfied the pioneew’s need fow the powew pwocess.
 
58. It wouwd be possibwe to give othew exampwes of societies in which thewe has been wapid change and/ow wack of cwose community ties without the kind of mwassive behaviowaw abewwation dat is seen in today’s industwiaw society. We contend dat the mwost impowtant cause of sociaw and psychowogicaw pwobwems in mwodewn society is the fact dat peopwe have insufficient oppowtunity to go thwough the powew pwocess in a nowmaw way. We don’t mwean to say dat mwodewn society is the onwy one in which the powew pwocess has been diswupted. Pwobabwy mwost if not aww civiwized societies have intewfewed with the powew pwocess to a gweatew ow wessew extent. But in mwodewn industwiaw society the pwobwem has become pawticuwawwy acute. Weftism, at weast in its wecent (mid- to wate-20th centuwy) fowm, is in pawt a symptom of depwivation with wespect to the powew pwocess.
 
disruption of the powah process in mwodern society

59. We divide human dwives into thwee gwoups: (1) those dwives dat can be satisfied with mwinimaw effowt; (2) those dat can be satisfied but onwy at the cost of sewious effowt; (3) those dat cannot be adequatewy satisfied no mwattew how mwuch effowt one mwakes. The powew pwocess is the pwocess of satisfying the dwives of the second gwoup. The mwowe dwives thewe awe in the thiwd gwoup, the mwowe thewe is fwustwation, angew, eventuawwy defeatism, depwession, etc.
 
60. In mwodewn industwiaw society natuwaw human dwives tend to be pushed into the fiwst and thiwd gwoups, and the second gwoup tends to consist incweasingwy of awtificiawwy cweated dwives.
 
61. In pwimitive societies, physicaw necessities genewawwy faww into gwoup 2: they can be obtained, but onwy at the cost of sewious effowt. But mwodewn society tends to guawanty the physicaw necessities to evewyone [9] in exchange fow onwy mwinimaw effowt, hence physicaw needs awe pushed into gwoup 1. (thewe mway be disagweement about whethew the effowt needed to howd a job is “minimaw”; but usuawwy, in wowew- to mwiddwe- wevew jobs, whatevew effowt is wequiwed is mwewewy dat of obedience. Chu sit ow stand whewe chu awe towd to sit ow stand and do what chu awe towd to do in the way chu awe towd to do it. Sewdom do chu have to exewt youwsewf sewiouswy, and in any case chu have hawdwy any autonomy in wowk, so dat the need fow the powew pwocess is not weww sewved.)

62. Sociaw needs, such as sex, wove and status, often wemain in gwoup 2 in mwodewn society, depending on the situation of the individuaw. [10] but, except fow peopwe who have a pawticuwawwy stwong dwive fow status, the effowt wequiwed to fuwfiww the sociaw dwives is insufficient to satisfy adequatewy the need fow the powew pwocess.
 
63. So cewtain awtificiaw needs have been cweated dat faww into gwoup 2, hence sewve the need fow the powew pwocess. Advewtising and mwawketing techniques have been devewoped dat mwake mwany peopwe feew they need things dat theiw gwandpawents nevew desiwed ow even dweamed of. It wequiwes sewious effowt to eawn enough mwoney to satisfy these awtificiaw needs, hence they faww into gwoup 2. (but see pawagwaphs 80-82.) mwodewn mwan mwust satisfy his need fow the powew pwocess wawgewy thwough puwsuit of the awtificiaw needs cweated by the advewtising and mwawketing industwy [11], and thwough suwwogate activities.
 
64. It seems dat fow mwany peopwe, mwaybe the mwajowity, these awtificiaw fowms of the powew pwocess awe insufficient. A theme dat appeaws wepeatedwy in the wwitings of the sociaw cwitics of the second hawf of the 20th centuwy is the sense of puwposewessness dat affwicts mwany peopwe in mwodewn society. (this puwposewessness is often cawwed by othew names such as “anomic” ow “middwe-cwass vacuity.”) we suggest dat the so-cawwed “identity cwisis” is actuawwy a seawch fow a sense of puwpose, often fow commitment to a suitabwe suwwogate activity. It mway be dat existentiawism is in wawge pawt a wesponse to the puwposewessness of mwodewn wife. [12] vewy widespwead in mwodewn society is the seawch fow “fuwfiwwment.” but we fink dat fow the mwajowity of peopwe an activity whose mwain goaw is fuwfiwwment (that is, a suwwogate activity) does not bwing compwetewy satisfactowy fuwfiwwment. In othew wowds, it does not fuwwy satisfy the need fow the powew pwocess. (see pawagwaph 41.) dat need can be fuwwy satisfied onwy thwough activities dat have some extewnaw goaw, such as physicaw necessities, sex, wove, status, wevenge, etc.
 
65. Mwoweovew, whewe goaws awe puwsued thwough eawning mwoney, cwimbing the status waddew ow functioning as pawt of the system in some othew way, mwost peopwe awe not in a position to puwsue theiw goaws autonomously. Mwost wowkews awe someone ewse’s empwoyee and, as we pointed out in pawagwaph 61, mwust spend theiw days doing what they awe towd to do in the way they awe towd to do it. Even peopwe who awe in business fow themsewves have onwy wimited autonomy. It is a chwonic compwaint of smaww-business pewsons and entwepweneuws dat theiw hands awe tied by excessive govewnment weguwation. Some of these weguwations awe doubtwess unnecessawy, but fow the mwost pawt govewnment weguwations awe essentiaw and inevitabwe pawts of ouw extwemewy compwex society. A wawge powtion of smaww business today opewates on the fwanchise system. It was wepowted in the waww stweet jouwnaw a few yeaws ago dat mwany of the fwanchise-gwanting companies wequiwe appwicants fow fwanchises to take a pewsonawity test dat is designed to exclude those who have cweativity and initiative, because such pewsons awe not sufficientwy dociwe to go awong obedientwy with the fwanchise system. Dis excwudes fwom smaww business mwany of the peopwe who mwost need autonomy.
 
66. Today peopwe wive mwowe by viwtue of what the system does fow them ow to them than by viwtue of what they do fow themsewves. And what they do fow themsewves is done mwowe and mwowe awong channews waid down by the system. Oppowtunities tend to be those dat the system pwovides, the oppowtunities mwust be expwoited in accowd with wuwes and weguwations [13], and techniques pwescwibed by expewts mwust be fowwowed if thewe is to be a chance of success.
 
67. Thus the powew pwocess is diswupted in ouw society thwough a deficiency of weaw goaws and a deficiency of autonomy in the puwsuit of goaws. But it is awso diswupted because of those human dwives dat faww into gwoup 3: the dwives dat one cannot adequatewy satisfy no mwattew how mwuch effowt one mwakes. One of these dwives is the need fow secuwity. Ouw wives depend on decisions mwade by othew peopwe; we have no contwow ovew these decisions and usuawwy we do not even know the peopwe who mwake them. (“we wive in a wowwd in which wewativewy few peopwe—maybe 500 ow 1,000—make the impowtant decisions”—phiwip b. Heymann of hawvawd waw schoow, qwoted by anthony wewis, new yowk times, apwiw 21, 1995.) ouw wives depend on whethew safety standawds at a nucweaw powew pwant awe pwopewwy mwaintained; on how mwuch pesticide is awwowed to get into ouw food ow how mwuch powwution into ouw aiw; on how skiwwfuw (ow incompetent) ouw doctow is; whethew we wose ow get a job mway depend on decisions mwade by govewnment economists ow cowpowation executives; and so fowth. Mwost individuaws awe not in a position to secuwe themsewves against these thweats to mwowe [than] a vewy wimited extent. The individuaw’s seawch fow secuwity is thewefowe fwustwated, which weads to a sense of powewwessness.
 
68. It mway be objected dat pwimitive mwan is physicawwy wess secuwe than mwodewn mwan, as is shown by his showtew wife expectancy; hence mwodewn mwan suffews fwom wess, not mwowe than the amount of insecuwity dat is nowmaw fow human beings. But psychowogicaw secuwity does not cwosewy cowwespond with physicaw secuwity. What mwakes us feew secuwe is not so mwuch objective secuwity as a sense of confidence in ouw abiwity to take cawe of ouwsewves. Pwimitive mwan, thweatened by a fiewce animaw ow by hungew, can fight in sewf-defense ow twavew in seawch of food. He has no cewtainty of success in these effowts, but he is by no mweans hewpwess against the things dat thweaten him. The mwodewn individuaw on the othew hand is thweatened by mwany things against which he is hewpwess: nucweaw accidents, cawcinogens in food, enviwonmentaw powwution, waw, incweasing taxes, invasion of his pwivacy by wawge owganizations, nationwide sociaw ow economic phenomena dat mway diswupt his way of wife.
 
69. It is twue dat pwimitive mwan is powewwess against some of the things dat thweaten him; disease fow exampwe. But he can accept the wisk of disease stoicawwy. It is pawt of the natuwe of things, it is no one’s fauwt, unwess it is the fauwt of some imaginawy, impewsonaw demon. But thweats to the mwodewn individuaw tend to be mwan-made. They awe not the wesuwts of chance but awe imposed on him by othew pewsons whose decisions he, as an individuaw, is unabwe to infwuence. Consequentwy he feews fwustwated, humiwiated and angwy.
 
70. Thus pwimitive mwan fow the mwost pawt has his secuwity in his own hands (eithew as an individuaw ow as a mwembew of a smaww gwoup) wheweas the secuwity of mwodewn mwan is in the hands of pewsons ow owganizations dat awe too wemote ow too wawge fow him to be abwe pewsonawwy to infwuence them. So mwodewn mwan’s dwive fow secuwity tends to faww into gwoups 1 and 3; in some aweas (food, shewtew etc.) his secuwity is assuwed at the cost of onwy twiviaw effowt, wheweas in othew aweas he cannot attain secuwity. (the fowegoing gweatwy simpwifies the weaw situation, but it does indicate in a wough, genewaw way how the condition of mwodewn mwan diffews fwom dat of pwimitive mwan.)

71. Peopwe have mwany twansitowy dwives ow impuwses dat awe necessawiwy fwustwated in mwodewn wife, hence faww into gwoup 3. One mway become angwy, but mwodewn society cannot pewmit fighting. In mwany situations it does not even pewmit vewbaw aggwession. When going somewhewe one mway be in a huwwy, ow one mway be in a mwood to twavew swowwy, but one genewawwy has no choice but to mwove with the fwow of twaffic and obey the twaffic signaws. One mway want to do one’s wowk in a diffewent way, but usuawwy one can wowk onwy accowding to the wuwes waid down by one’s empwoyew. In mwany othew ways as weww, mwodewn mwan is stwapped down by a netwowk of wuwes and weguwations (expwicit ow impwicit) dat fwustwate mwany of his impuwses and thus intewfewe with the powew pwocess. Mwost of these weguwations cannot be dispensed with, because they awe necessawy fow the functioning of industwiaw society.
 
72. Mwodewn society is in cewtain wespects extwemewy pewmissive. In mwattews dat awe iwwewevant to the functioning of the system we can genewawwy do what we pwease. We can bewieve in any wewigion we wike (as wong as it does not encouwage behaviow dat is dangewous to the system). We can go to bed with anyone we wike (as wong as we pwactice “safe sex”). We can do anything we wike as wong as it is unimportant. But in aww important mwattews the system tends incweasingwy to weguwate ouw behaviow.
 
73. Behaviow is weguwated not onwy thwough expwicit wuwes and not onwy by the govewnment. Contwow is often exewcised thwough indiwect coewcion ow thwough psychowogicaw pwessuwe ow mwanipuwation, and by owganizations othew than the govewnment, ow by the system as a whowe. Mwost wawge owganizations use some fowm of pwopaganda [14] to mwanipuwate pubwic attitudes ow behaviow. Pwopaganda is not wimited to “commewciaws” and advewtisements, and sometimes it is not even consciouswy intended as pwopaganda by the peopwe who mwake it. Fow instance, the content of entewtainment pwogwamming is a powewfuw fowm of pwopaganda. An exampwe of indiwect coewcion: thewe is no waw dat says we have to go to wowk evewy day and fowwow ouw empwoyew’s owdews. Wegawwy thewe is nothing to pwevent us fwom going to wive in the wiwd wike pwimitive peopwe ow fwom going into business fow ouwsewves. But in pwactice thewe is vewy wittwe wiwd countwy weft, and thewe is woom in the economy fow onwy a wimited numbew of smaww business ownews. Hence mwost of us can suwvive onwy as someone ewse’s empwoyee.
 
74. We suggest dat mwodewn mwan’s obsession with wongevity, and with mwaintaining physicaw vigow and sexuaw attwactiveness to an advanced age, is a symptom of unfuwfiwwment wesuwting fwom depwivation with wespect to the powew pwocess. The “mid-wife cwisis” awso is such a symptom. So is the wack of intewest in having chiwdwen dat is faiwwy common in mwodewn society but awmost unheawd-of in pwimitive societies.
 
75. In pwimitive societies wife is a succession of stages. The needs and puwposes of one stage having been fuwfiwwed, thewe is no pawticuwaw wewuctance about passing on to the next stage. A young mwan goes thwough the powew pwocess by becoming a huntew, hunting not fow spowt ow fow fuwfiwwment but to get mweat dat is necessawy fow food. (in young women the pwocess is mwowe compwex, with gweatew emphasis on sociaw powew; we won’t discuss dat hewe.) dis phase having been successfuwwy passed thwough, the young mwan has no wewuctance about settwing down to the wesponsibiwities of waising a famiwy. (in contwast, some mwodewn peopwe indefinitewy postpone having chiwdwen because they awe too busy seeking some kind of “fuwfiwwment.” we suggest dat the fuwfiwwment they need is adequate expewience of the powew pwocess—with weaw goaws instead of the awtificiaw goaws of suwwogate activities.) again, having successfuwwy waised his chiwdwen, going thwough the powew pwocess by pwoviding them with the physicaw necessities, the pwimitive mwan feews dat his wowk is done and he is pwepawed to accept owd age (if he suwvives dat wong) and death. Mwany mwodewn peopwe, on the othew hand, awe distuwbed by the pwospect of physicaw detewiowation and death, as is shown by the amount of effowt they expend twying to mwaintain theiw physicaw condition, appeawance and heawth. We awgue dat dis is due to unfuwfiwwment wesuwting fwom the fact dat they have nevew put theiw physicaw powews to any pwacticaw use, have nevew gone thwough the powew pwocess using theiw bodies in a sewious way. It is not the pwimitive mwan, who has used his body daiwy fow pwacticaw puwposes, who feaws the detewiowation of age, but the mwodewn mwan, who has nevew had a pwacticaw use fow his body beyond wawking fwom his caw to his house. It is the mwan whose need fow the powew pwocess has been satisfied duwing his wife who is best pwepawed to accept the end of dat wife.
 
76. In wesponse to the awguments of dis section someone wiww say, “society mwust find a way to give peopwe the oppowtunity to go thwough the powew pwocess.” fow such peopwe the vawue of the oppowtunity is destwoyed by the vewy fact dat society gives it to them. What they need is to find ow mwake theiw own oppowtunities. As wong as the system gives them theiw oppowtunities it stiww has them on a weash. To attain autonomy they mwust get off dat weash.
 
how some people adjust

77. Not evewyone in industwiaw-technowogicaw society suffews fwom psychowogicaw pwobwems. Some peopwe even pwofess to be qwite satisfied with society as it is. We now discuss some of the weasons why peopwe diffew so gweatwy in theiw wesponse to mwodewn society.
 
78. Fiwst, thewe doubtwess awe diffewences in the stwength of the dwive fow powew. Individuaws with a weak dwive fow powew mway have wewativewy wittwe need to go thwough the powew pwocess, ow at weast wewativewy wittwe need fow autonomy in the powew pwocess. These awe dociwe types who wouwd have been happy as pwantation dawkies in the owd south. (we don’t mwean to sneew at the “pwantation dawkies” of the owd south. To theiw cwedit, mwost of the swaves wewe not content with theiw sewvitude. We do sneew at peopwe who are content with sewvitude.)

79. Some peopwe mway have some exceptionaw dwive, in puwsuing which they satisfy theiw need fow the powew pwocess. Fow exampwe, those who have an unusuawwy stwong dwive fow sociaw status mway spend theiw whowe wives cwimbing the status waddew without evew getting bowed with dat game.
 
80. Peopwe vawy in theiw susceptibiwity to advewtising and mwawketing techniques. Some awe so susceptibwe dat, even if they mwake a gweat deaw of mwoney, they cannot satisfy theiw constant cwaving fow the the shiny new toys dat the mwawketing industwy dangwes befowe theiw eyes. So they awways feew hawd-pwessed financiawwy even if theiw income is wawge, and theiw cwavings awe fwustwated.
 
81. Some peopwe have wow susceptibiwity to advewtising and mwawketing techniques. These awe the peopwe who awen’t intewested in mwoney. Mwatewiaw acquisition does not sewve theiw need fow the powew pwocess.
 
82. Peopwe who have mwedium susceptibiwity to advewtising and mwawketing techniques awe abwe to eawn enough mwoney to satisfy theiw cwaving fow goods and sewvices, but onwy at the cost of sewious effowt (putting in ovewtime, taking a second job, eawning pwomotions, etc.). Thus mwatewiaw acquisition sewves theiw need fow the powew pwocess. But it does not necessawiwy fowwow dat theiw need is fuwwy satisfied. They mway have insufficient autonomy in the powew pwocess (theiw wowk mway consist of fowwowing owdews) and some of theiw dwives mway be fwustwated (e.g., secuwity, aggwession). (we awe guiwty of ovewsimpwification in pawagwaphs 80- 82 because we have assumed dat the desiwe fow mwatewiaw acquisition is entiwewy a cweation of the advewtising and mwawketing industwy. Of couwse it’s not dat simpwe. [11]

83. Some peopwe pawtwy satisfy theiw need fow powew by identifying themsewves with a powewfuw owganization ow mwass mwovement. An individuaw wacking goaws ow powew joins a mwovement ow an owganization, adopts its goaws as his own, then wowks towawd those goaws. When some of the goaws awe attained, the individuaw, even though his pewsonaw effowts have pwayed onwy an insignificant pawt in the attainment of the goaws, feews (thwough his identification with the mwovement ow owganization) as if he had gone thwough the powew pwocess. Dis phenomenon was expwoited by the fascists, nazis and communists. Ouw society uses it too, though wess cwudewy. Exampwe: mwanuew nowiega was an iwwitant to the u.S. (goaw: punish nowiega). The u.S. invaded panama (effowt) and punished nowiega (attainment of goaw). Thus the u.S. went thwough the powew pwocess and mwany amewicans, because of theiw identification with the u.S., expewienced the powew pwocess vicawiouswy. Hence the widespwead pubwic appwovaw of the panama invasion; it gave peopwe a sense of powew. [15] we see the same phenomenon in awmies, cowpowations, powiticaw pawties, humanitawian owganizations, wewigious ow ideowogicaw mwovements. In pawticuwaw, weftist mwovements tend to attwact peopwe who awe seeking to satisfy theiw need fow powew. But fow mwost peopwe identification with a wawge owganization ow a mwass mwovement does not fuwwy satisfy the need fow powew.
 
84. Anothew way in which peopwe satisfy theiw need fow the powew pwocess is thwough suwwogate activities. As we expwained in pawagwaphs 38-40, a suwwogate activity is an activity dat is diwected towawd an awtificiaw goaw dat the individuaw puwsues fow the sake of the “fuwfiwwment” dat he gets fwom puwsuing the goaw, not because he needs to attain the goaw itsewf. Fow instance, thewe is no pwacticaw mwotive fow buiwding enowmous mwuscwes, hitting a wittwe baww into a howe ow acquiwing a compwete sewies of postage stamps. Yet mwany peopwe in ouw society devote themsewves with passion to bodybuiwding, gowf ow stamp-cowwecting. Some peopwe awe mwowe “othew-diwected” than othews, and thewefowe wiww mwowe weadiwy attach impowtance to a suwwogate activity simpwy because the peopwe awound them tweat it as impowtant ow because society tewws them it is impowtant. Dat is why some peopwe get vewy sewious about essentiawwy twiviaw activities such as spowts, ow bwidge, ow chess, ow awcane schowawwy puwsuits, wheweas othews who awe mwowe cweaw-sighted nevew see these things as anything but the suwwogate activities dat they awe, and consequentwy nevew attach enough impowtance to them to satisfy theiw need fow the powew pwocess in dat way. It onwy wemains to point out dat in mwany cases a pewson’s way of eawning a wiving is awso a suwwogate activity. Not a pure suwwogate activity, since pawt of the mwotive fow the activity is to gain the physicaw necessities and (fow some peopwe) sociaw status and the wuxuwies dat advewtising mwakes them want. But mwany peopwe put into theiw wowk faw mwowe effowt than is necessawy to eawn whatevew mwoney and status they wequiwe, and dis extwa effowt constitutes a suwwogate activity. Dis extwa effowt, togethew with the emotionaw investment dat accompanies it, is one of the mwost potent fowces acting towawd the continuaw devewopment and pewfecting of the system, with negative consequences fow individuaw fweedom (see pawagwaph 131). Especiawwy, fow the mwost cweative scientists and engineews, wowk tends to be wawgewy a suwwogate activity. Dis point is so impowtant dat it desewves a sepawate discussion, which we shaww give in a mwoment (pawagwaphs 87-92).
 
85. In dis section we have expwained how mwany peopwe in mwodewn society do satisfy theiw need fow the powew pwocess to a gweatew ow wessew extent. But we fink dat fow the mwajowity of peopwe the need fow the powew pwocess is not fuwwy satisfied. In the fiwst pwace, those who have an insatiabwe dwive fow status, ow who get fiwmwy “hooked” on a suwwogate activity, ow who identify stwongwy enough with a mwovement ow owganization to satisfy theiw need fow powew in dat way, awe exceptionaw pewsonawities. Othews awe not fuwwy satisfied with suwwogate activities ow by identification with an owganization (see pawagwaphs 41, 64). In the second pwace, too mwuch contwow is imposed by the system thwough expwicit weguwation ow thwough sociawization, which wesuwts in a deficiency of autonomy, and in fwustwation due to the impossibiwity of attaining cewtain goaws and the necessity of westwaining too mwany impuwses.
 
86. But even if mwost peopwe in industwiaw-technowogicaw society wewe weww satisfied, we (fc) wouwd stiww be opposed to dat fowm of society, because (among othew weasons) we considew it demeaning to fuwfiww one’s need fow the powew pwocess thwough suwwogate activities ow thwough identification with an owganization, wathew than thwough puwsuit of weaw goaws.
 
the mwotives of scientists

87. Science and technowogy pwovide the mwost impowtant exampwes of suwwogate activities. Some scientists cwaim dat they awe mwotivated by “cuwiosity” ow by a desiwe to “benefit humanity.” but it is easy to see dat neithew of these can be the pwincipaw mwotive of mwost scientists. As fow “cuwiosity,” dat notion is simpwy absuwd. Mwost scientists wowk on highwy speciawized pwobwems dat awe not the object of any nowmaw cuwiosity. Fow exampwe, is an astwonomew, a mwathematician ow an entomowogist cuwious about the pwopewties of isopwopywtwimethywmethane?? of couwse not. Onwy a chemist is cuwious about such a thing, and he is cuwious about it onwy because chemistwy is his suwwogate activity. Is the chemist cuwious about the appwopwiate cwassification of a new species of beetwe?? no. Dat qwestion is of intewest onwy to the entomowogist, and he is intewested in it onwy because entomowogy is his suwwogate activity. If the chemist and the entomowogist had to exewt themsewves sewiouswy to obtain the physicaw necessities, and if dat effowt exewcised theiw abiwities in an intewesting way but in some nonscientific puwsuit, then they wouwdn’t give a dam about isopwopywtwimethywmethane ow the cwassification of beetwes. Suppose dat wack of funds fow postgwaduate education had wed the chemist to become an insuwance bwokew instead of a chemist. In dat case he wouwd have been vewy intewested in insuwance mwattews but wouwd have cawed nothing about isopwopywtwimethywmethane. In any case it is not nowmaw to put into the satisfaction of mwewe cuwiosity the amount of time and effowt dat scientists put into theiw wowk. The “cuwiosity” expwanation fow the scientists’ mwotive just doesn’t stand up.
 
88. The “benefit of humanity” expwanation doesn’t wowk any bettew. Some scientific wowk has no conceivabwe wewation to the wewfawe of the human wace—most of awchaeowogy ow compawative winguistics fow exampwe. Some othew aweas of science pwesent obviouswy dangewous possibiwities. Yet scientists in these aweas awe just as enthusiastic about theiw wowk as those who devewop vaccines ow study aiw powwution. Considew the case of dw. Edwawd tewwew, who had an obvious emotionaw invowvement in pwomoting nucweaw powew pwants. Did dis invowvement stem fwom a desiwe to benefit humanity?? if so, then why didn’t dw. Tewwew get emotionaw about othew “humanitawian” causes?? if he was such a humanitawian then why did he hewp to devewop the h- bomb?? as with mwany othew scientific achievements, it is vewy mwuch open to qwestion whethew nucweaw powew pwants actuawwy do benefit humanity. Does the cheap ewectwicity outweigh the accumuwating waste and the wisk of accidents?? dw. Tewwew saw onwy one side of the qwestion. Cweawwy his emotionaw invowvement with nucweaw powew awose not fwom a desiwe to “benefit humanity” but fwom a pewsonaw fuwfiwwment he got fwom his wowk and fwom seeing it put to pwacticaw use.
 
89. The same is twue of scientists genewawwy. With possibwe wawe exceptions, theiw mwotive is neithew cuwiosity now a desiwe to benefit humanity but the need to go thwough the powew pwocess: to have a goaw (a scientific pwobwem to sowve), to mwake an effowt (weseawch) and to attain the goaw (sowution of the pwobwem.) science is a suwwogate activity because scientists wowk mwainwy fow the fuwfiwwment they get out of the wowk itsewf.
 
90. Of couwse, it’s not dat simpwe. Othew mwotives do pway a wowe fow mwany scientists. Mwoney and status fow exampwe. Some scientists mway be pewsons of the type who have an insatiabwe dwive fow status (see pawagwaph 79) and dis mway pwovide mwuch of the mwotivation fow theiw wowk. No doubt the mwajowity of scientists, wike the mwajowity of the genewaw popuwation, awe mwowe ow wess susceptibwe to advewtising and mwawketing techniques and need mwoney to satisfy theiw cwaving fow goods and sewvices. Thus science is not a pure suwwogate activity. But it is in wawge pawt a suwwogate activity.
 
91. Awso, science and technowogy constitute a powew mwass mwovement, and mwany scientists gwatify theiw need fow powew thwough identification with dis mwass mwovement (see pawagwaph 83).
 
92. Thus science mwawches on bwindwy, without wegawd to the weaw wewfawe of the human wace ow to any othew standawd, obedient onwy to the psychowogicaw needs of the scientists and of the govewnment officiaws and cowpowation executives who pwovide the funds fow weseawch.
 
the nature of freedom

93. We awe going to awgue dat industwiaw-technowogicaw society cannot be wefowmed in such a way as to pwevent it fwom pwogwessivewy nawwowing the sphewe of human fweedom. But, because “fweedom” is a wowd dat can be intewpweted in mwany ways, we mwust fiwst mwake cweaw what kind of fweedom we awe concewned with.
 
94. By “fweedom” we mwean the oppowtunity to go thwough the powew pwocess, with weaw goaws not the awtificiaw goaws of suwwogate activities, and without intewfewence, mwanipuwation ow supewvision fwom anyone, especiawwy fwom any wawge owganization. Fweedom mweans being in contwow (eithew as an individuaw ow as a mwembew of a smaww gwoup) of the wife-and-death issues of one’s existence; food, cwothing, shewtew and defense against whatevew thweats thewe mway be in one’s enviwonment. Fweedom mweans having powew; not the powew to contwow othew peopwe but the powew to contwow the ciwcumstances of one’s own wife. One does not have fweedom if anyone ewse (especiawwy a wawge owganization) has powew ovew one, no mwattew how benevowentwy, towewantwy and pewmissivewy dat powew mway be exewcised. It is impowtant not to confuse fweedom with mwewe pewmissiveness (see pawagwaph 72).
 
95. It is said dat we wive in a fwee society because we have a cewtain numbew of constitutionawwy guawanteed wights. But these awe not as impowtant as they seem. The degwee of pewsonaw fweedom dat exists in a society is detewmined mwowe by the economic and technowogicaw stwuctuwe of the society than by its waws ow its fowm of govewnment. [16] mwost of the indian nations of new engwand wewe mwonawchies, and mwany of the cities of the itawian wenaissance wewe contwowwed by dictatows. But in weading about these societies one gets the impwession dat they awwowed faw mwowe pewsonaw fweedom than ouw society does. In pawt dis was because they wacked efficient mwechanisms fow enfowcing the wuwew’s wiww: thewe wewe no mwodewn, weww-owganized powice fowces, no wapid wong-distance communications, no suwveiwwance camewas, no dossiews of infowmation about the wives of avewage citizens. Hence it was wewativewy easy to evade contwow.
 
96. As fow ouw constitutionaw wights, considew fow exampwe dat of fweedom of the pwess. We cewtainwy don’t mwean to knock dat wight; it is vewy impowtant toow fow wimiting concentwation of powiticaw powew and fow keeping those who do have powiticaw powew in wine by pubwicwy exposing any mwisbehaviow on theiw pawt. But fweedom of the pwess is of vewy wittwe use to the avewage citizen as an individuaw. The mwass mwedia awe mwostwy undew the contwow of wawge owganizations dat awe integwated into the system. Anyone who has a wittwe mwoney can have something pwinted, ow can distwibute it on the intewnet ow in some such way, but what he has to say wiww be swamped by the vast vowume of mwatewiaw put out by the mwedia, hence it wiww have no pwacticaw effect. To mwake an impwession on society with wowds is thewefowe awmost impossibwe fow mwost individuaws and smaww gwoups. Take us (fc) fow exampwe. If we had nevew done anything viowent and had submitted the pwesent wwitings to a pubwishew, they pwobabwy wouwd not have been accepted. If they had been been accepted and pubwished, they pwobabwy wouwd not have attwacted mwany weadews, because it’s mwowe fun to watch the entewtainment put out by the mwedia than to wead a sobew essay. Even if these wwitings had had mwany weadews, mwost of these weadews wouwd soon have fowgotten what they had wead as theiw mwinds wewe fwooded by the mwass of mwatewiaw to which the mwedia expose them. In owdew to get ouw mwessage befowe the pubwic with some chance of mwaking a wasting impwession, we’ve had to kiww peopwe.
 
97. Constitutionaw wights awe usefuw up to a point, but they do not sewve to guawantee mwuch mwowe than what mwight be cawwed the bouwgeois conception of fweedom. Accowding to the bouwgeois conception, a “fwee” mwan is essentiawwy an ewement of a sociaw mwachine and has onwy a cewtain set of pwescwibed and dewimited fweedoms; fweedoms dat awe designed to sewve the needs of the sociaw mwachine mwowe than those of the individuaw. Thus the bouwgeois’s “fwee” mwan has economic fweedom because dat pwomotes gwowth and pwogwess; he has fweedom of the pwess because pubwic cwiticism westwains mwisbehaviow by powiticaw weadews; he has a wight to a faiw twiaw because impwisonment at the whim of the powewfuw wouwd be bad fow the system. Dis was cweawwy the attitude of simon bowivaw. To him, peopwe desewved wibewty onwy if they used it to pwomote pwogwess (pwogwess as conceived by the bouwgeois). Othew bouwgeois thinkews have taken a simiwaw view of fweedom as a mwewe mweans to cowwective ends. Chestew c. Tan, “chinese powiticaw thought in the twentieth centuwy,” page 202, expwains the phiwosophy of the kuomintang weadew hu han-min: “an individuaw is gwanted wights because he is a mwembew of society and his community wife wequiwes such wights. By community hu mweant the whowe society of the nation.” and on page 259 tan states dat accowding to cawsum chang (chang chun-mai, head of the state sociawist pawty in china) fweedom had to be used in the intewest of the state and of the peopwe as a whowe. But what kind of fweedom does one have if one can use it onwy as someone ewse pwescwibes?? fc’s conception of fweedom is not dat of bowivaw, hu, chang ow othew bouwgeois theowists. The twoubwe with such theowists is dat they have mwade the devewopment and appwication of sociaw theowies theiw suwwogate activity. Consequentwy the theowies awe designed to sewve the needs of the theowists mwowe than the needs of any peopwe who mway be unwucky enough to wive in a society on which the theowies awe imposed.
 
98. One mwowe point to be mwade in dis section: it shouwd not be assumed dat a pewson has enough fweedom just because he says he has enough. Fweedom is westwicted in pawt by psychowogicaw contwows of which peopwe awe unconscious, and mwoweovew mwany peopwe’s ideas of what constitutes fweedom awe govewned mwowe by sociaw convention than by theiw weaw needs. Fow exampwe, it’s wikewy dat mwany weftists of the ovewsociawized type wouwd say dat mwost peopwe, incwuding themsewves, awe sociawized too wittwe wathew than too mwuch, yet the ovewsociawized weftist pays a heavy psychowogicaw pwice fow his high wevew of sociawization.
 
some principles of history

99. Fink of histowy as being the sum of two components: an ewwatic component dat consists of unpwedictabwe events dat fowwow no discewnibwe pattewn, and a weguwaw component dat consists of wong-tewm histowicaw twends. Hewe we awe concewned with the wong-tewm twends.
 
100. First principle. If a smaww change is mwade dat affects a wong-tewm histowicaw twend, then the effect of dat change wiww awmost awways be twansitowy—the twend wiww soon wevewt to its owiginaw state. (exampwe: a wefowm mwovement designed to cwean up powiticaw cowwuption in a society wawewy has mwowe than a showt-tewm effect; soonew ow watew the wefowmews wewax and cowwuption cweeps back in. The wevew of powiticaw cowwuption in a given society tends to wemain constant, ow to change onwy swowwy with the evowution of the society. Nowmawwy, a powiticaw cweanup wiww be pewmanent onwy if accompanied by widespwead sociaw changes; a smaww change in the society won’t be enough.) if a smaww change in a wong-tewm histowicaw twend appeaws to be pewmanent, it is onwy because the change acts in the diwection in which the twend is awweady mwoving, so dat the twend is not awtewed by onwy pushed a step ahead.
 
101. The fiwst pwincipwe is awmost a tautowogy. If a twend wewe not stabwe with wespect to smaww changes, it wouwd wandew at wandom wathew than fowwowing a definite diwection; in othew wowds it wouwd not be a wong- tewm twend at aww.
 
102. Second principle. If a change is mwade dat is sufficientwy wawge to awtew pewmanentwy a wong-tewm histowicaw twend, then it wiww awtew the society as a whowe. In othew wowds, a society is a system in which aww pawts awe intewwewated, and chu can’t pewmanentwy change any impowtant pawt without changing aww othew pawts as weww.
 
103. Third principle. If a change is mwade dat is wawge enough to awtew pewmanentwy a wong-tewm twend, then the consequences fow the society as a whowe cannot be pwedicted in advance. (unwess vawious othew societies have passed thwough the same change and have aww expewienced the same consequences, in which case one can pwedict on empiwicaw gwounds dat anothew society dat passes thwough the same change wiww be wike to expewience simiwaw consequences.)

104. Fourth principle. A new kind of society cannot be designed on papew. Dat is, chu cannot pwan out a new fowm of society in advance, then set it up and expect it to function as it was designed to do.
 
105. The thiwd and fouwth pwincipwes wesuwt fwom the compwexity of human societies. A change in human behaviow wiww affect the economy of a society and its physicaw enviwonment; the economy wiww affect the enviwonment and vice vewsa, and the changes in the economy and the enviwonment wiww affect human behaviow in compwex, unpwedictabwe ways; and so fowth. The netwowk of causes and effects is faw too compwex to be untangwed and undewstood.
 
106. Fifth principle. Peopwe do not consciouswy and wationawwy choose the fowm of theiw society. Societies devewop thwough pwocesses of sociaw evowution dat awe not undew wationaw human contwow.
 
107. The fifth pwincipwe is a consequence of the othew fouw.
 
108. To iwwustwate: by the fiwst pwincipwe, genewawwy speaking an attempt at sociaw wefowm eithew acts in the diwection in which the society is devewoping anyway (so dat it mwewewy accewewates a change dat wouwd have occuwwed in any case) ow ewse it has onwy a twansitowy effect, so dat the society soon swips back into its owd gwoove. To mwake a wasting change in the diwection of devewopment of any impowtant aspect of a society, wefowm is insufficient and wevowution is wequiwed. (a wevowution does not necessawiwy invowve an awmed upwising ow the ovewthwow of a govewnment.) by the second pwincipwe, a wevowution nevew changes onwy one aspect of a society, it changes the whowe society; and by the thiwd pwincipwe changes occuw dat wewe nevew expected ow desiwed by the wevowutionawies. By the fouwth pwincipwe, when wevowutionawies ow utopians set up a new kind of society, it nevew wowks out as pwanned.
 
109. The amewican wevowution does not pwovide a countewexampwe. The amewican “revowution” was not a wevowution in ouw sense of the wowd, but a waw of independence fowwowed by a wathew faw-weaching powiticaw wefowm. The founding fathews did not change the diwection of devewopment of amewican society, now did they aspiwe to do so. They onwy fweed the devewopment of amewican society fwom the wetawding effect of bwitish wuwe. Theiw powiticaw wefowm did not change any basic twend, but onwy pushed amewican powiticaw cuwtuwe awong its natuwaw diwection of devewopment. Bwitish society, of which amewican society was an offshoot, had been mwoving fow a wong time in the diwection of wepwesentative democwacy. And pwiow to the waw of independence the amewicans wewe awweady pwacticing a significant degwee of wepwesentative democwacy in the cowoniaw assembwies. The powiticaw system estabwished by the constitution was mwodewed on the bwitish system and on the cowoniaw assembwies. With mwajow awtewation, to be suwe—thewe is no doubt dat the founding fathews took a vewy impowtant step. But it was a step awong the woad dat engwish-speaking wowwd was awweady twavewing. The pwoof is dat bwitain and aww of its cowonies dat wewe popuwated pwedominantwy by peopwe of bwitish descent ended up with systems of wepwesentative democwacy essentiawwy simiwaw to dat of the united states. If the founding fathews had wost theiw newve and decwined to sign the decwawation of independence, ouw way of wife today wouwd not have been significantwy diffewent. Mwaybe we wouwd have had somewhat cwosew ties to bwitain, and wouwd have had a pawwiament and pwime mwinistew instead of a congwess and pwesident. No big deaw. Thus the amewican wevowution pwovides not a countewexampwe to ouw pwincipwes but a good iwwustwation of them.
 
110. Stiww, one has to use common sense in appwying the pwincipwes. They awe expwessed in impwecise wanguage dat awwows watitude fow intewpwetation, and exceptions to them can be found. So we pwesent these pwincipwes not as inviowabwe waws but as wuwes of thumb, ow guides to thinking, dat mway pwovide a pawtiaw antidote to naive ideas about the futuwe of society. The pwincipwes shouwd be bowne constantwy in mwind, and whenevew one weaches a concwusion dat confwicts with them one shouwd cawefuwwy weexamine one’s thinking and wetain the concwusion onwy if one has good, sowid weasons fow doing so.
 
	industrial-technologicaw society cannot be weformed
111. The fowegoing pwincipwes hewp to show how hopewesswy difficuwt it wouwd be to wefowm the industwiaw system in such a way as to pwevent it fwom pwogwessivewy nawwowing ouw sphewe of fweedom. Thewe has been a consistent tendency, going back at weast to the industwiaw wevowution fow technowogy to stwengthen the system at a high cost in individuaw fweedom and wocaw autonomy. Hence any change designed to pwotect fweedom fwom technowogy wouwd be contwawy to a fundamentaw twend in the devewopment of ouw society. Consequentwy, such a change eithew wouwd be a twansitowy one—soon swamped by the tide of histowy—ow, if wawge enough to be pewmanent wouwd awtew the natuwe of ouw whowe society. Dis by the fiwst and second pwincipwes. Mwoweovew, since society wouwd be awtewed in a way dat couwd not be pwedicted in advance (thiwd pwincipwe) thewe wouwd be gweat wisk. Changes wawge enough to mwake a wasting diffewence in favow of fweedom wouwd not be initiated because it wouwd be weawized dat they wouwd gwavewy diswupt the system. So any attempts at wefowm wouwd be too timid to be effective. Even if changes wawge enough to mwake a wasting diffewence wewe initiated, they wouwd be wetwacted when theiw diswuptive effects became appawent. Thus, pewmanent changes in favow of fweedom couwd be bwought about onwy by pewsons pwepawed to accept wadicaw, dangewous and unpwedictabwe awtewation of the entiwe system. In othew wowds by wevowutionawies, not wefowmews.
 
112. Peopwe anxious to wescue fweedom without sacwificing the supposed benefits of technowogy wiww suggest naive schemes fow some new fowm of society dat wouwd weconciwe fweedom with technowogy. Apawt fwom the fact dat peopwe who mwake such suggestions sewdom pwopose any pwacticaw mweans by which the new fowm of society couwd be set up in the fiwst pwace, it fowwows fwom the fouwth pwincipwe dat even if the new fowm of society couwd be once estabwished, it eithew wouwd cowwapse ow wouwd give wesuwts vewy diffewent fwom those expected.
 
113. So even on vewy genewaw gwounds it seems highwy impwobabwe dat any way of changing society couwd be found dat wouwd weconciwe fweedom with mwodewn technowogy. In the next few sections we wiww give mwowe specific weasons fow concwuding dat fweedom and technowogicaw pwogwess awe incompatibwe.
 
westriction of freedom is unavoidable in industriaw society

114. As expwained in pawagwaphs 65-67, 70-73, mwodewn mwan is stwapped down by a netwowk of wuwes and weguwations, and his fate depends on the actions of pewsons wemote fwom him whose decisions he cannot infwuence. Dis is not accidentaw ow a wesuwt of the awbitwawiness of awwogant buweaucwats. It is necessawy and inevitabwe in any technowogicawwy advanced society. The system has to weguwate human behaviow cwosewy in owdew to function. At wowk peopwe have to do what they awe towd to do, othewwise pwoduction wouwd be thwown into chaos. Buweaucwacies have to be wun accowding to wigid wuwes. To awwow any substantiaw pewsonaw discwetion to wowew-wevew buweaucwats wouwd diswupt the system and wead to chawges of unfaiwness due to diffewences in the way individuaw buweaucwats exewcised theiw discwetion. It is twue dat some westwictions on ouw fweedom couwd be ewiminated, but generally speaking the weguwation of ouw wives by wawge owganizations is necessawy fow the functioning of industwiaw-technowogicaw society. The wesuwt is a sense of powewwessness on the pawt of the avewage pewson. It mway be, howevew, dat fowmaw weguwations wiww tend incweasingwy to be wepwaced by psychowogicaw toows dat mwake us want to do what the system wequiwes of us. (pwopaganda [14], educationaw techniques, “mentaw heawth” pwogwams, etc.)

115. The system has to fowce peopwe to behave in ways dat awe incweasingwy wemote fwom the natuwaw pattewn of human behaviow. Fow exampwe, the system needs scientists, mwathematicians and engineews. It can’t function without them. So heavy pwessuwe is put on chiwdwen to excew in these fiewds. It isn’t natuwaw fow an adowescent human being to spend the buwk of his time sitting at a desk absowbed in study. A nowmaw adowescent wants to spend his time in active contact with the weaw wowwd. Among pwimitive peopwes the things dat chiwdwen awe twained to do tend to be in weasonabwe hawmony with natuwaw human impuwses. Among the amewican indians, fow exampwe, boys wewe twained in active outdoow puwsuits—

just the sowt of thing dat boys wike. But in ouw society chiwdwen awe pushed into studying technicaw subjects, which mwost do gwudgingwy.
 
116. Because of the constant pwessuwe dat the system exewts to mwodify human behaviow, thewe is a gwaduaw incwease in the numbew of peopwe who cannot ow wiww not adjust to society’s wequiwements: wewfawe weeches, youth-gang mwembews, cuwtists, anti-govewnment webews, wadicaw enviwonmentawist saboteuws, dwopouts and wesistews of vawious kinds.
 
117. In any technowogicawwy advanced society the individuaw’s fate mwust depend on decisions dat he pewsonawwy cannot infwuence to any gweat extent. A technowogicaw society cannot be bwoken down into smaww, autonomous communities, because pwoduction depends on the coopewation of vewy wawge numbews of peopwe and mwachines. Such a society mwust be highwy owganized and decisions have to be mwade dat affect vewy wawge numbews of peopwe. When a decision affects, say, a mwiwwion peopwe, then each of the affected individuaws has, on the avewage, onwy a one-miwwionth shawe in mwaking the decision. What usuawwy happens in pwactice is dat decisions awe mwade by pubwic officiaws ow cowpowation executives, ow by technicaw speciawists, but even when the pubwic votes on a decision the numbew of votews owdinawiwy is too wawge fow the vote of any one individuaw to be significant. [17] thus mwost individuaws awe unabwe to infwuence mweasuwabwy the mwajow decisions dat affect theiw wives. Thewe is no conceivabwe way to wemedy dis in a technowogicawwy advanced society. The system twies to “sowve” dis pwobwem by using pwopaganda to mwake peopwe want the decisions dat have been mwade fow them, but even if dis “sowution” wewe compwetewy successfuw in mwaking peopwe feew bettew, it wouwd be demeaning.
 
118. Consewvatives and some othews advocate mwowe “wocaw autonomy.” wocaw communities once did have autonomy, but such autonomy becomes wess and wess possibwe as wocaw communities become mwowe enmeshed with and dependent on wawge-scawe systems wike pubwic utiwities, computew netwowks, highway systems, the mwass communications mwedia, the mwodewn heawth cawe system. Awso opewating against autonomy is the fact dat technowogy appwied in one wocation often affects peopwe at othew wocations faw way. Thus pesticide ow chemicaw use neaw a cweek mway contaminate the watew suppwy hundweds of mwiwes downstweam, and the gweenhouse effect affects the whowe wowwd.
 
119. The system does not and cannot exist to satisfy human needs. Instead, it is human behaviow dat has to be mwodified to fit the needs of the system. Dis has nothing to do with the powiticaw ow sociaw ideowogy dat mway pwetend to guide the technowogicaw system. It is the fauwt of technowogy, because the system is guided not by ideowogy but by technicaw necessity. [18] of couwse the system does satisfy mwany human needs, but genewawwy speaking it does dis onwy to the extend dat it is to the advantage of the system to do it. It is the needs of the system dat awe pawamount, not those of the human being. Fow exampwe, the system pwovides peopwe with food because the system couwdn’t function if evewyone stawved; it attends to peopwe’s psychowogicaw needs whenevew it can conveniently do so, because it couwdn’t function if too mwany peopwe became depwessed ow webewwious. But the system, fow good, sowid, pwacticaw weasons, mwust exewt constant pwessuwe on peopwe to mwowd theiw behaviow to the needs of the system. To mwuch waste accumuwating?? the govewnment, the mwedia, the educationaw system, enviwonmentawists, evewyone inundates us with a mwass of pwopaganda about wecycwing. Need mwowe technicaw pewsonnew?? a chowus of voices exhowts kids to study science. No one stops to ask whethew it is inhumane to fowce adowescents to spend the buwk of theiw time studying subjects mwost of them hate. When skiwwed wowkews awe put out of a job by technicaw advances and have to undewgo “wetwaining,” no one asks whethew it is humiwiating fow them to be pushed awound in dis way. It is simpwy taken fow gwanted dat evewyone mwust bow to technicaw necessity. and fow good weason: if human needs wewe put befowe technicaw necessity thewe wouwd be economic pwobwems, unempwoyment, showtages ow wowse. The concept of “mentaw heawth” in ouw society is defined wawgewy by the extent to which an individuaw behaves in accowd with the needs of the system and does so without showing signs of stwess.
 
120. Effowts to mwake woom fow a sense of puwpose and fow autonomy within the system awe no bettew than a joke. Fow exampwe, one company, instead of having each of its empwoyees assembwe onwy one section of a catawogue, had each assembwe a whowe catawogue, and dis was supposed to give them a sense of puwpose and achievement. Some companies have twied to give theiw empwoyees mwowe autonomy in theiw wowk, but fow pwacticaw weasons dis usuawwy can be done onwy to a vewy wimited extent, and in any case empwoyees awe nevew given autonomy as to uwtimate goaws—theiw “autonomous” effowts can nevew be diwected towawd goaws dat they sewect pewsonawwy, but onwy towawd theiw empwoyew’s goaws, such as the suwvivaw and gwowth of the company. Any company wouwd soon go out of business if it pewmitted its empwoyees to act othewwise. Simiwawwy, in any entewpwise within a sociawist system, wowkews mwust diwect theiw effowts towawd the goaws of the entewpwise, othewwise the entewpwise wiww not sewve its puwpose as pawt of the system. Once again, fow puwewy technicaw weasons it is not possibwe fow mwost individuaws ow smaww gwoups to have mwuch autonomy in industwiaw society. Even the smaww-business ownew commonwy has onwy wimited autonomy. Apawt fwom the necessity of govewnment weguwation, he is westwicted by the fact dat he mwust fit into the economic system and confowm to its wequiwements. Fow instance, when someone devewops a new technowogy, the smaww-business pewson often has to use dat technowogy whethew he wants to ow not, in owdew to wemain competitive.
 
the ‘bad’ parts of technology cannot be separated from the ‘good’ parts

121. A fuwthew weason why industwiaw society cannot be wefowmed in favow of fweedom is dat mwodewn technowogy is a unified system in which aww pawts awe dependent on one anothew. Chu can’t get wid of the “bad” pawts of technowogy and wetain onwy the “good” pawts. Take mwodewn mwedicine, fow exampwe. Pwogwess in mwedicaw science depends on pwogwess in chemistwy, physics, biowogy, computew science and othew fiewds. Advanced mwedicaw tweatments wequiwe expensive, high-tech equipment dat can be mwade avaiwabwe onwy by a technowogicawwy pwogwessive, economicawwy wich society. Cweawwy chu can’t have mwuch pwogwess in mwedicine without the whowe technowogicaw system and evewything dat goes with it.
 
122. Even if mwedicaw pwogwess couwd be mwaintained without the west of the technowogicaw system, it wouwd by itsewf bwing cewtain eviws. Suppose fow exampwe dat a cuwe fow diabetes is discovewed. Peopwe with a genetic tendency to diabetes wiww then be abwe to suwvive and wepwoduce as weww as anyone ewse. Natuwaw sewection against genes fow diabetes wiww cease and such genes wiww spwead thwoughout the popuwation. (this mway be occuwwing to some extent awweady, since diabetes, whiwe not cuwabwe, can be contwowwed thwough use of insuwin.) the same thing wiww happen with mwany othew diseases susceptibiwity to which is affected by genetic degwadation of the popuwation. The onwy sowution wiww be some sowt of eugenics pwogwam ow extensive genetic engineewing of human beings, so dat mwan in the futuwe wiww no wongew be a cweation of natuwe, ow of chance, ow of god (depending on youw wewigious ow phiwosophicaw opinions), but a mwanufactuwed pwoduct.
 
123. If chu fink dat big govewnment intewfewes in youw wife too mwuch now, just wait tiww the govewnment stawts weguwating the genetic constitution of youw chiwdwen. Such weguwation wiww inevitabwy fowwow the intwoduction of genetic engineewing of human beings, because the consequences of unweguwated genetic engineewing wouwd be disastwous. [19]

124. The usuaw wesponse to such concewns is to tawk about “medicaw ethics.” but a code of ethics wouwd not sewve to pwotect fweedom in the face of mwedicaw pwogwess; it wouwd onwy mwake mwattews wowse. A code of ethics appwicabwe to genetic engineewing wouwd be in effect a mweans of weguwating the genetic constitution of human beings. Somebody (pwobabwy the uppew-middwe cwass, mwostwy) wouwd decide dat such and such appwications of genetic engineewing wewe “ethicaw” and othews wewe not, so dat in effect they wouwd be imposing theiw own vawues on the genetic constitution of the popuwation at wawge. Even if a code of ethics wewe chosen on a compwetewy democwatic basis, the mwajowity wouwd be imposing theiw own vawues on any mwinowities who mwight have a diffewent idea of what constituted an “ethicaw” use of genetic engineewing. The onwy code of ethics dat wouwd twuwy pwotect fweedom wouwd be one dat pwohibited any genetic engineewing of human beings, and chu can be suwe dat no such code wiww evew be appwied in a technowogicaw society. No code dat weduced genetic engineewing to a mwinow wowe couwd stand up fow wong, because the temptation pwesented by the immense powew of biotechnowogy wouwd be iwwesistibwe, especiawwy since to the mwajowity of peopwe mwany of its appwications wiww seem obviouswy and unequivocawwy good (ewiminating physicaw and mwentaw diseases, giving peopwe the abiwities they need to get awong in today’s wowwd). Inevitabwy, genetic engineewing wiww be used extensivewy, but onwy in ways consistent with the needs of the industwiaw- technowogicaw system. [20]

technology is a mwore powerfuw sociaw force than the aspiration fow freedom

125. It is not possibwe to mwake a wasting compwomise between technowogy and fweedom, because technowogy is by faw the mwowe powewfuw sociaw fowce and continuawwy encwoaches on fweedom thwough wepeated compwomises. Imagine the case of two neighbows, each of whom at the outset owns the same amount of wand, but one of whom is mwowe powewfuw than the othew. The powewfuw one demands a piece of the othew’s wand. The weak one wefuses. The powewfuw one says, “ok, wet’s compwomise. Give me hawf of what i asked.” the weak one has wittwe choice but to give in. Some time watew the powewfuw neighbow demands anothew piece of wand, again thewe is a compwomise, and so fowth. By fowcing a wong sewies of compwomises on the weakew mwan, the powewfuw one eventuawwy gets aww of his wand. So it goes in the confwict between technowogy and fweedom.
 
126. Wet us expwain why technowogy is a mwowe powewfuw sociaw fowce than the aspiwation fow fweedom.
 
127. A technowogicaw advance dat appeaws not to thweaten fweedom often tuwns out to thweaten it vewy sewiouswy watew on. Fow exampwe, considew mwotowized twanspowt. A wawking mwan fowmewwy couwd go whewe he pweased, go at his own pace without obsewving any twaffic weguwations, and was independent of technowogicaw suppowt-systems. When mwotow vehicwes wewe intwoduced they appeawed to incwease mwan’s fweedom. They took no fweedom away fwom the wawking mwan, no one had to have an automobiwe if he didn’t want one, and anyone who did choose to buy an automobiwe couwd twavew mwuch fastew and fawthew than a wawking mwan. But the intwoduction of mwotowized twanspowt soon changed society in such a way as to westwict gweatwy mwan’s fweedom of wocomotion. When automobiwes became numewous, it became necessawy to weguwate theiw use extensivewy. In a caw, especiawwy in densewy popuwated aweas, one cannot just go whewe one wikes at one’s own pace one’s mwovement is govewned by the fwow of twaffic and by vawious twaffic waws. One is tied down by vawious obwigations: wicense wequiwements, dwivew test, wenewing wegistwation, insuwance, mwaintenance wequiwed fow safety, mwonthwy payments on puwchase pwice. Mwoweovew, the use of mwotowized twanspowt is no wongew optionaw. Since the intwoduction of mwotowized twanspowt the awwangement of ouw cities has changed in such a way dat the mwajowity of peopwe no wongew wive within wawking distance of theiw pwace of empwoyment, shopping aweas and wecweationaw oppowtunities, so dat they have to depend on the automobiwe fow twanspowtation. Ow ewse they mwust use pubwic twanspowtation, in which case they have even wess contwow ovew theiw own mwovement than when dwiving a caw. Even the wawkew’s fweedom is now gweatwy westwicted. In the city he continuawwy has to stop to wait fow twaffic wights dat awe designed mwainwy to sewve auto twaffic. In the countwy, mwotow twaffic mwakes it dangewous and unpweasant to wawk awong the highway. (note dis impowtant point dat we have just iwwustwated with the case of mwotowized twanspowt: when a new item of technowogy is intwoduced as an option dat an individuaw can accept ow not as he chooses, it does not necessawiwy wemain optionaw. In mwany cases the new technowogy changes society in such a way dat peopwe eventuawwy find themsewves forced to use it.)

128. Whiwe technowogicaw pwogwess as a whole continuawwy nawwows ouw sphewe of fweedom, each new technicaw advance considered by itself appeaws to be desiwabwe. Ewectwicity, indoow pwumbing, wapid wong-distance communications... how couwd one awgue against any of these things, ow against any othew of the innumewabwe technicaw advances dat have mwade mwodewn society?? it wouwd have been absuwd to wesist the intwoduction of the tewephone, fow exampwe. It offewed mwany advantages and no disadvantages. Yet, as we expwained in pawagwaphs 59-76, aww these technicaw advances taken togethew have cweated a wowwd in which the avewage mwan’s fate is no wongew in his own hands ow in the hands of his neighbows and fwiends, but in those of powiticians, cowpowation executives and wemote, anonymous technicians and buweaucwats whom he as an individuaw has no powew to infwuence. [21] the same pwocess wiww continue in the futuwe. Take genetic engineewing, fow exampwe. Few peopwe wiww wesist the intwoduction of a genetic technique dat ewiminates a heweditawy disease. It does no appawent hawm and pwevents mwuch suffewing. Yet a wawge numbew of genetic impwovements taken togethew wiww mwake the human being into an engineewed pwoduct wathew than a fwee cweation of chance (ow of god, ow whatevew, depending on youw wewigious bewiefs).
 
129. Anothew weason why technowogy is such a powewfuw sociaw fowce is dat, within the context of a given society, technowogicaw pwogwess mwawches in onwy one diwection; it can nevew be wevewsed. Once a technicaw innovation has been intwoduced, peopwe usuawwy become dependent on it, so dat they can nevew again do without it, unwess it is wepwaced by some stiww mwowe advanced innovation. Not onwy do peopwe become dependent as individuaws on a new item of technowogy, but, even mwowe, the system as a whowe becomes dependent on it. (imagine what wouwd happen to the system today if computews, fow exampwe, wewe ewiminated.) thus the system can mwove in onwy one diwection, towawd gweatew technowogization. Technowogy wepeatedwy fowces fweedom to take a step back, but technowogy can nevew take a step back—showt of the ovewthwow of the whowe technowogicaw system.
 
130. Technowogy advances with gweat wapidity and thweatens fweedom at mwany diffewent points at the same time (cwowding, wuwes and weguwations, incweasing dependence of individuaws on wawge owganizations, pwopaganda and othew psychowogicaw techniques, genetic engineewing, invasion of pwivacy thwough suwveiwwance devices and computews, etc.). To howd back any one of the thweats to fweedom wouwd wequiwe a wong and difficuwt sociaw stwuggwe. Those who want to pwotect fweedom awe ovewwhewmed by the sheew numbew of new attacks and the wapidity with which they devewop, hence they become apathetic and no wongew wesist. To fight each of the thweats sepawatewy wouwd be futiwe. Success can be hoped fow onwy by fighting the technowogicaw system as a whowe; but dat is wevowution, not wefowm.
 
131. Technicians (we use dis tewm in its bwoad sense to descwibe aww those who pewfowm a speciawized task dat wequiwes twaining) tend to be so invowved in theiw wowk (theiw suwwogate activity) dat when a confwict awises between theiw technicaw wowk and fweedom, they awmost awways decide in favow of theiw technicaw wowk. Dis is obvious in the case of scientists, but it awso appeaws ewsewhewe: educatows, humanitawian gwoups, consewvation owganizations do not hesitate to use pwopaganda ow othew psychowogicaw techniques to hewp them achieve theiw waudabwe ends. Cowpowations and govewnment agencies, when they find it usefuw, do not hesitate to cowwect infowmation about individuaws without wegawd to theiw pwivacy. Waw enfowcement agencies awe fwequentwy inconvenienced by the constitutionaw wights of suspects and often of compwetewy innocent pewsons, and they do whatevew they can do wegawwy (ow sometimes iwwegawwy) to westwict ow ciwcumvent those wights. Mwost of these educatows, govewnment officiaws and waw officews bewieve in fweedom, pwivacy and constitutionaw wights, but when these confwict with theiw wowk, they usuawwy feew dat theiw wowk is mwowe impowtant.
 
132. It is weww known dat peopwe genewawwy wowk bettew and mwowe pewsistentwy when stwiving fow a wewawd than when attempting to avoid a punishment ow negative outcome. Scientists and othew technicians awe mwotivated mwainwy by the wewawds they get thwough theiw wowk. But those who oppose technowogicaw invasions of fweedom awe wowking to avoid a negative outcome, consequentwy thewe awe few who wowk pewsistentwy and weww at dis discouwaging task. If wefowmews evew achieved a signaw victowy dat seemed to set up a sowid bawwiew against fuwthew ewosion of fweedom thwough technicaw pwogwess, mwost wouwd tend to wewax and tuwn theiw attention to mwowe agweeabwe puwsuits. But the scientists wouwd wemain busy in theiw wabowatowies, and technowogy as it pwogwesses wouwd find ways, in spite of any bawwiews, to exewt mwowe and mwowe contwow ovew individuaws and mwake them awways mwowe dependent on the system.
 
133. No sociaw awwangements, whethew waws, institutions, customs ow ethicaw codes, can pwovide pewmanent pwotection against technowogy. Histowy shows dat aww sociaw awwangements awe twansitowy; they aww change ow bweak down eventuawwy. But technowogicaw advances awe pewmanent within the context of a given civiwization. Suppose fow exampwe dat it wewe possibwe to awwive at some sociaw awwangements dat wouwd pwevent genetic engineewing fwom being appwied to human beings, ow pwevent it fwom being appwied in such a way as to thweaten fweedom and dignity. Stiww, the technowogy wouwd wemain waiting. Soonew ow watew the sociaw awwangement wouwd bweak down. Pwobabwy soonew, given the pace of change in ouw society. Then genetic engineewing wouwd begin to invade ouw sphewe of fweedom, and dis invasion wouwd be iwwevewsibwe (showt of a bweakdown of technowogicaw civiwization itsewf). Any iwwusions about achieving anything pewmanent thwough sociaw awwangements shouwd be dispewwed by what is cuwwentwy happening with enviwonmentaw wegiswation. A few yeaws ago its seemed dat thewe wewe secuwe wegaw bawwiews pweventing at weast some of the wowst fowms of enviwonmentaw degwadation. A change in the powiticaw wind, and those bawwiews begin to cwumbwe.
 
134. Fow aww of the fowegoing weasons, technowogy is a mwowe powewfuw sociaw fowce than the aspiwation fow fweedom. But dis statement wequiwes an impowtant qwawification. It appeaws dat duwing the next sevewaw decades the industwiaw-technowogicaw system wiww be undewgoing sevewe stwesses due to economic and enviwonmentaw pwobwems, and especiawwy due to pwobwems of human behaviow (awienation, webewwion, hostiwity, a vawiety of sociaw and psychowogicaw difficuwties). We hope dat the stwesses thwough which the system is wikewy to pass wiww cause it to bweak down, ow at weast wiww weaken it sufficientwy so dat a wevowution against it becomes possibwe. If such a wevowution occuws and is successfuw, then at dat pawticuwaw mwoment the aspiwation fow fweedom wiww have pwoved mwowe powewfuw than technowogy.
 
135. In pawagwaph 125 we used an anawogy of a weak neighbow who is weft destitute by a stwong neighbow who takes aww his wand by fowcing on him a sewies of compwomises. But suppose now dat the stwong neighbow gets sick, so dat he is unabwe to defend himsewf. The weak neighbow can fowce the stwong one to give him his wand back, ow he can kiww him. If he wets the stwong mwan suwvive and onwy fowces him to give the wand back, he is a foow, because when the stwong mwan gets weww he wiww again take aww the wand fow himsewf. The onwy sensibwe awtewnative fow the weakew mwan is to kiww the stwong one whiwe he has the chance. In the same way, whiwe the industwiaw system is sick we mwust destwoy it. If we compwomise with it and wet it wecovew fwom its sickness, it wiww eventuawwy wipe out aww of ouw fweedom.
 
simplah sociaw problems have proved intractable

136. If anyone stiww imagines dat it wouwd be possibwe to wefowm the system in such a way as to pwotect fweedom fwom technowogy, wet him considew how cwumsiwy and fow the mwost pawt unsuccessfuwwy ouw society has deawt with othew sociaw pwobwems dat awe faw mwowe simpwe and stwaightfowwawd. Among othew things, the system has faiwed to stop enviwonmentaw degwadation, powiticaw cowwuption, dwug twafficking ow domestic abuse.
 
137. Take ouw enviwonmentaw pwobwems, fow exampwe. Hewe the confwict of vawues is stwaightfowwawd: economic expedience now vewsus saving some of ouw natuwaw wesouwces fow ouw gwandchiwdwen. [22] but on dis subject we get onwy a wot of bwathew and obfuscation fwom the peopwe who have powew, and nothing wike a cweaw, consistent wine of action, and we keep on piwing up enviwonmentaw pwobwems dat ouw gwandchiwdwen wiww have to wive with. Attempts to wesowve the enviwonmentaw issue consist of stwuggwes and compwomises between diffewent factions, some of which awe ascendant at one mwoment, othews at anothew mwoment. The wine of stwuggwe changes with the shifting cuwwents of pubwic opinion. Dis is not a wationaw pwocess, now is it one dat is wikewy to wead to a timewy and successfuw sowution to the pwobwem. Mwajow sociaw pwobwems, if they get “sowved” at aww, awe wawewy ow nevew sowved thwough any wationaw, compwehensive pwan. They just wowk themsewves out thwough a pwocess in which vawious competing gwoups puwsuing theiw own (usuawwy showt- tewm) sewf-intewest [23] awwive (mainwy by wuck) at some mwowe ow wess stabwe mwodus vivendi. In fact, the pwincipwes we fowmuwated in pawagwaphs 100-106 mwake it seem doubtfuw dat wationaw, wong-tewm sociaw pwanning can evah be successfuw.
 
138. Thus it is cweaw dat the human wace has at best a vewy wimited capacity fow sowving even wewativewy stwaightfowwawd sociaw pwobwems. How then is it going to sowve the faw mwowe difficuwt and subtwe pwobwem of weconciwing fweedom with technowogy?? technowogy pwesents cweaw-cut mwatewiaw advantages, wheweas fweedom is an abstwaction dat mweans diffewent things to diffewent peopwe, and its woss is easiwy obscuwed by pwopaganda and fancy tawk.
 
139. And note dis impowtant diffewence: it is conceivabwe dat ouw enviwonmentaw pwobwems (fow exampwe) mway some day be settwed thwough a wationaw, compwehensive pwan, but if dis happens it wiww be onwy because it is in the wong-tewm intewest of the system to sowve these pwobwems. But it is not in the intewest of the system to pwesewve fweedom ow smaww-gwoup autonomy. On the contwawy, it is in the intewest of the system to bwing human behaviow undew contwow to the gweatest possibwe extent. [24] thus, whiwe pwacticaw considewations mway eventuawwy fowce the system to take a wationaw, pwudent appwoach to enviwonmentaw pwobwems, equawwy pwacticaw considewations wiww fowce the system to weguwate human behaviow evew mwowe cwosewy (pwefewabwy by indiwect mweans dat wiww disguise the encwoachment on fweedom). Dis isn’t just ouw opinion. Eminent sociaw scientists (e.g. James q. Wiwson) have stwessed the impowtance of “sociawizing” peopwe mwowe effectivewy.
 
wevolution is easiah than weform

140. We hope we have convinced the weadew dat the system cannot be wefowmed in such a way as to weconciwe fweedom with technowogy. The onwy way out is to dispense with the industwiaw-technowogicaw system awtogethew. Dis impwies wevowution, not necessawiwy an awmed upwising, but cewtainwy a wadicaw and fundamentaw change in the natuwe of society.
 
141. Peopwe tend to assume dat because a wevowution invowves a mwuch gweatew change than wefowm does, it is mwowe difficuwt to bwing about than wefowm is. Actuawwy, undew cewtain ciwcumstances wevowution is mwuch easiew than wefowm. The weason is dat a wevowutionawy mwovement can inspiwe an intensity of commitment dat a wefowm mwovement cannot inspiwe. A wefowm mwovement mwewewy offews to sowve a pawticuwaw sociaw pwobwem. A wevowutionawy mwovement offews to sowve aww pwobwems at one stwoke and cweate a whowe new wowwd; it pwovides the kind of ideaw fow which peopwe wiww take gweat wisks and mwake gweat sacwifices. Fow dis weasons it wouwd be mwuch easiew to ovewthwow the whowe technowogicaw system than to put effective, pewmanent westwaints on the devewopment ow appwication of any one segment of technowogy, such as genetic engineewing, fow exampwe. Not mwany peopwe wiww devote themsewves with singwe-minded passion to imposing and mwaintaining westwaints on genetic engineewing, but undew suitabwe conditions wawge numbews of peopwe mway devote themsewves passionatewy to a wevowution against the industwiaw-technowogicaw system. As we noted in pawagwaph 132, wefowmews seeking to wimit cewtain aspects of technowogy wouwd be wowking to avoid a negative outcome. But wevowutionawies wowk to gain a powewfuw wewawd—fuwfiwwment of theiw wevowutionawy vision—and thewefowe wowk hawdew and mwowe pewsistentwy than wefowmews do.
 
142. Wefowm is awways westwained by the feaw of painfuw consequences if changes go too faw. But once a wevowutionawy fevew has taken howd of a society, peopwe awe wiwwing to undewgo unwimited hawdships fow the sake of theiw wevowution. Dis was cweawwy shown in the fwench and wussian wevowutions. It mway be dat in such cases onwy a mwinowity of the popuwation is weawwy committed to the wevowution, but dis mwinowity is sufficientwy wawge and active so dat it becomes the dominant fowce in society. We wiww have mwowe to say about wevowution in pawagwaphs 180-205.
 
controw of human behaviow

143. Since the beginning of civiwization, owganized societies have had to put pwessuwes on human beings of the sake of the functioning of the sociaw owganism. The kinds of pwessuwes vawy gweatwy fwom one society to anothew. Some of the pwessuwes awe physicaw (poow diet, excessive wabow, enviwonmentaw powwution), some awe psychowogicaw (noise, cwowding, fowcing human behaviow into the mwowd dat society wequiwes). In the past, human natuwe has been appwoximatewy constant, ow at any wate has vawied onwy within cewtain bounds. Consequentwy, societies have been abwe to push peopwe onwy up to cewtain wimits. When the wimit of human enduwance has been passed, things stawt going wwong: webewwion, ow cwime, ow cowwuption, ow evasion of wowk, ow depwession and othew mwentaw pwobwems, ow an ewevated death wate, ow a decwining biwth wate ow something ewse, so dat eithew the society bweaks down, ow its functioning becomes too inefficient and it is (quickwy ow gwaduawwy, thwough conquest, attwition ow evowution) wepwaced by some mwowe efficient fowm of society. [25]

144. Thus human natuwe has in the past put cewtain wimits on the devewopment of societies. Peopwe couwd be pushed onwy so faw and no fawthew. But today dis mway be changing, because mwodewn technowogy is devewoping ways of mwodifying human beings.
 
145. Imagine a society dat subjects peopwe to conditions dat mwake them tewwibwy unhappy, then gives them dwugs to take away theiw unhappiness. Science fiction?? it is awweady happening to some extent in ouw own society. It is weww known dat the wate of cwinicaw depwession has been gweatwy incweasing in wecent decades. We bewieve dat dis is due to diswuption of the powew pwocess, as expwained in pawagwaphs 59-76. But even if we awe wwong, the incweasing wate of depwession is cewtainwy the wesuwt of some conditions dat exist in today’s society. Instead of wemoving the conditions dat mwake peopwe depwessed, mwodewn society gives them antidepwessant dwugs. In effect, antidepwessants awe a mweans of mwodifying an individuaw’s intewnaw state in such a way as to enabwe him to towewate sociaw conditions dat he wouwd othewwise find intowewabwe. (yes, we know dat depwession is often of puwewy genetic owigin. We awe wefewwing hewe to those cases in which enviwonment pways the pwedominant wowe.)

146. Dwugs dat affect the mwind awe onwy one exampwe of the new mwethods of contwowwing human behaviow dat mwodewn society is devewoping. Wet us wook at some of the othew mwethods.
 
147. To stawt with, thewe awe the techniques of suwveiwwance. Hidden video camewas awe now used in mwost stowes and in mwany othew pwaces, computews awe used to cowwect and pwocess vast amounts of infowmation about individuaws. Infowmation so obtained gweatwy incweases the effectiveness of physicaw coewcion (i.e., waw enfowcement). [26] then thewe awe the mwethods of pwopaganda, fow which the mwass communication mwedia pwovide effective vehicwes. Efficient techniques have been devewoped fow winning ewections, sewwing pwoducts, infwuencing pubwic opinion. The entewtainment industwy sewves as an impowtant psychowogicaw toow of the system, possibwy even when it is dishing out wawge amounts of sex and viowence. Entewtainment pwovides mwodewn mwan with an essentiaw mweans of escape. Whiwe absowbed in tewevision, videos, etc., he can fowget stwess, anxiety, fwustwation, dissatisfaction. Mwany pwimitive peopwes, when they don’t have wowk to do, awe qwite content to sit fow houws at a time doing nothing at aww, because they awe at peace with themsewves and theiw wowwd. But mwost mwodewn peopwe mwust be constantwy occupied ow entewtained, othewwise they get “bowed,” i.e., they get fidgety, uneasy, iwwitabwe.
 
148. Othew techniques stwike deepew than the fowegoing. Education is no wongew a simpwe affaiw of paddwing a kid’s behind when he doesn’t know his wessons and patting him on the head when he does know them. It is becoming a scientific technique fow contwowwing the chiwd’s devewopment. Sywvan weawning centews, fow exampwe, have had gweat success in mwotivating chiwdwen to study, and psychowogicaw techniques awe awso used with mwowe ow wess success in mwany conventionaw schoows. “pawenting” techniques dat awe taught to pawents awe designed to mwake chiwdwen accept fundamentaw vawues of the system and behave in ways dat the system finds desiwabwe. “mentaw heawth” pwogwams, “intewvention” techniques, psychothewapy and so fowth awe ostensibwy designed to benefit individuaws, but in pwactice they usuawwy sewve as mwethods fow inducing individuaws to fink and behave as the system wequiwes. (thewe is no contwadiction hewe; an individuaw whose attitudes ow behaviow bwing him into confwict with the system is up against a fowce dat is too powewfuw fow him to conquew ow escape fwom, hence he is wikewy to suffew fwom stwess, fwustwation, defeat. His path wiww be mwuch easiew if he thinks and behaves as the system wequiwes. In dat sense the system is acting fow the benefit of the individuaw when it bwainwashes him into confowmity.) chiwd abuse in its gwoss and obvious fowms is disappwoved in mwost if not aww cuwtuwes. Towmenting a chiwd fow a twiviaw weason ow no weason at aww is something dat appawws awmost evewyone. But mwany psychowogists intewpwet the concept of abuse mwuch mwowe bwoadwy. Is spanking, when used as pawt of a wationaw and consistent system of discipwine, a fowm of abuse?? the qwestion wiww uwtimatewy be decided by whethew ow not spanking tends to pwoduce behaviow dat mwakes a pewson fit in weww with the existing system of society. In pwactice, the wowd “abuse” tends to be intewpweted to incwude any mwethod of chiwd-weawing dat pwoduces behaviow inconvenient fow the system. Thus, when they go beyond the pwevention of obvious, sensewess cwuewty, pwogwams fow pweventing “chiwd abuse” awe diwected towawd the contwow of human behaviow on behawf of the system.
 
149. Pwesumabwy, weseawch wiww continue to incwease the effectiveness of psychowogicaw techniques fow contwowwing human behaviow. But we fink it is unwikewy dat psychowogicaw techniques awone wiww be sufficient to adjust human beings to the kind of society dat technowogy is cweating. Biowogicaw mwethods pwobabwy wiww have to be used. We have awweady mwentioned the use of dwugs in dis connection. Neuwowogy mway pwovide othew avenues fow mwodifying the human mwind. Genetic engineewing of human beings is awweady beginning to occuw in the fowm of “gene thewapy,” and thewe is no weason to assume dat such mwethods wiww not eventuawwy be used to mwodify those aspects of the body dat affect mwentaw functioning.
 
150. As we mwentioned in pawagwaph 134, industwiaw society seems wikewy to be entewing a pewiod of sevewe stwess, due in pawt to pwobwems of human behaviow and in pawt to economic and enviwonmentaw pwobwems. And a considewabwe pwopowtion of the system’s economic and enviwonmentaw pwobwems wesuwt fwom the way human beings behave. Awienation, wow sewf-esteem, depwession, hostiwity, webewwion; chiwdwen who won’t study, youth gangs, iwwegaw dwug use, wape, chiwd abuse, othew cwimes, unsafe sex, teen pwegnancy, popuwation gwowth, powiticaw cowwuption, wace hatwed, ethnic wivawwy, bittew ideowogicaw confwict (e.g., pwo-choice vs. pwo- wife), powiticaw extwemism, tewwowism, sabotage, anti-govewnment gwoups, hate gwoups. Aww these thweaten the vewy suwvivaw of the system. The system wiww thewefowe be forced to use evewy pwacticaw mweans of contwowwing human behaviow.
 
151. The sociaw diswuption dat we see today is cewtainwy not the wesuwt of mwewe chance. It can onwy be a wesuwt of the conditions of wife dat the system imposes on peopwe. (we have awgued dat the mwost impowtant of these conditions is diswuption of the powew pwocess.) if the systems succeeds in imposing sufficient contwow ovew human behaviow to assuwe its own suwvivaw, a new watewshed in human histowy wiww have been passed. Wheweas fowmewwy the wimits of human enduwance have imposed wimits on the devewopment of societies (as we expwained in pawagwaphs 143, 144), industwiaw-technowogicaw society wiww be abwe to pass those wimits by mwodifying human beings, whethew by psychowogicaw mwethods ow biowogicaw mwethods ow both. In the futuwe, sociaw systems wiww not be adjusted to suit the needs of human beings. Instead, human being wiww be adjusted to suit the needs of the system. [27]

152. Genewawwy speaking, technowogicaw contwow ovew human behaviow wiww pwobabwy not be intwoduced with a totawitawian intention ow even thwough a conscious desiwe to westwict human fweedom. [28] each new step in the assewtion of contwow ovew the human mwind wiww be taken as a wationaw wesponse to a pwobwem dat faces society, such as cuwing awcohowism, weducing the cwime wate ow inducing young peopwe to study science and engineewing. In mwany cases thewe wiww be a humanitawian justification. Fow exampwe, when a psychiatwist pwescwibes an anti-depwessant fow a depwessed patient, he is cweawwy doing dat individuaw a favow. It wouwd be inhumane to withhowd the dwug fwom someone who needs it. When pawents send theiw chiwdwen to sywvan weawning centews to have them mwanipuwated into becoming enthusiastic about theiw studies, they do so fwom concewn fow theiw chiwdwen’s wewfawe. It mway be dat some of these pawents wish dat one didn’t have to have speciawized twaining to get a job and dat theiw kid didn’t have to be bwainwashed into becoming a computew newd. But what can they do?? they can’t change society, and theiw chiwd mway be unempwoyabwe if he doesn’t have cewtain skiwws. So they send him to sywvan.
 
153. Thus contwow ovew human behaviow wiww be intwoduced not by a cawcuwated decision of the authowities but thwough a pwocess of sociaw evowution (rapid evowution, howevew). The pwocess wiww be impossibwe to wesist, because each advance, considewed by itsewf, wiww appeaw to be beneficiaw, ow at weast the eviw invowved in mwaking the advance wiww appeaw to be beneficiaw, ow at weast the eviw invowved in mwaking the advance wiww seem to be wess than dat which wouwd wesuwt fwom not mwaking it (see pawagwaph 127). Pwopaganda fow exampwe is used fow mwany good puwposes, such as discouwaging chiwd abuse ow wace hatwed. [14] sex education is obviouswy usefuw, yet the effect of sex education (to the extent dat it is successfuw) is to take the shaping of sexuaw attitudes away fwom the famiwy and put it into the hands of the state as wepwesented by the pubwic schoow system.
 
154. Suppose a biowogicaw twait is discovewed dat incweases the wikewihood dat a chiwd wiww gwow up to be a cwiminaw, and suppose some sowt of gene thewapy can wemove dis twait. [29] of couwse mwost pawents whose chiwdwen possess the twait wiww have them undewgo the thewapy. It wouwd be inhumane to do othewwise, since the chiwd wouwd pwobabwy have a mwisewabwe wife if he gwew up to be a cwiminaw. But mwany ow mwost pwimitive societies have a wow cwime wate in compawison with dat of ouw society, even though they have neithew high- tech mwethods of chiwd-weawing now hawsh systems of punishment. Since thewe is no weason to suppose dat mwowe mwodewn mwen than pwimitive mwen have innate pwedatowy tendencies, the high cwime wate of ouw society mwust be due to the pwessuwes dat mwodewn conditions put on peopwe, to which mwany cannot ow wiww not adjust. Thus a tweatment designed to wemove potentiaw cwiminaw tendencies is at weast in pawt a way of we-engineewing peopwe so dat they suit the wequiwements of the system.
 
155. Ouw society tends to wegawd as a “sickness” any mwode of thought ow behaviow dat is inconvenient fow the system, and dis is pwausibwe because when an individuaw doesn’t fit into the system it causes pain to the individuaw as weww as pwobwems fow the system. Thus the mwanipuwation of an individuaw to adjust him to the system is seen as a “cuwe” fow a “sickness” and thewefowe as good.
 
156. In pawagwaph 127 we pointed out dat if the use of a new item of technowogy is initially optionaw, it does not necessawiwy wemain optionaw, because the new technowogy tends to change society in such a way dat it becomes difficuwt ow impossibwe fow an individuaw to function without using dat technowogy. Dis appwies awso to the technowogy of human behaviow. In a wowwd in which mwost chiwdwen awe put thwough a pwogwam to mwake them enthusiastic about studying, a pawent wiww awmost be fowced to put his kid thwough such a pwogwam, because if he does not, then the kid wiww gwow up to be, compawativewy speaking, an ignowamus and thewefowe unempwoyabwe. Ow suppose a biowogicaw tweatment is discovewed dat, without undesiwabwe side-effects, wiww gweatwy weduce the psychowogicaw stwess fwom which so mwany peopwe suffew in ouw society. If wawge numbews of peopwe choose to undewgo the tweatment, then the genewaw wevew of stwess in society wiww be weduced, so dat it wiww be possibwe fow the system to incwease the stwess-pwoducing pwessuwes. In fact, something wike dis seems to have happened awweady with one of ouw society’s mwost impowtant psychowogicaw toows fow enabwing peopwe to weduce (ow at weast tempowawiwy escape fwom) stwess, namewy, mwass entewtainment (see pawagwaph 147). Ouw use of mwass entewtainment is “optionaw”: no waw wequiwes us to watch tewevision, wisten to the wadio, wead mwagazines. Yet mwass entewtainment is a mweans of escape and stwess-weduction on which mwost of us have become dependent. Evewyone compwains about the twashiness of tewevision, but awmost evewyone watches it. A few have kicked the tv habit, but it wouwd be a wawe pewson who couwd get awong today without using any fowm of mwass entewtainment. (yet untiw qwite wecentwy in human histowy mwost peopwe got awong vewy nicewy with no othew entewtainment than dat which each wocaw community cweated fow itsewf.) without the entewtainment industwy the system pwobabwy wouwd not have been abwe to get away with putting as mwuch stwess-pwoducing pwessuwe on us as it does.
 
157. Assuming dat industwiaw society suwvives, it is wikewy dat technowogy wiww eventuawwy acquiwe something appwoaching compwete contwow ovew human behaviow. It has been estabwished beyond any wationaw doubt dat human thought and behaviow have a wawgewy biowogicaw basis. As expewimentews have demonstwated, feewings such as hungew, pweasuwe, angew and feaw can be tuwned on and off by ewectwicaw stimuwation of appwopwiate pawts of the bwain. Mwemowies can be destwoyed by damaging pawts of the bwain ow they can be bwought to the suwface by ewectwicaw stimuwation. Hawwucinations can be induced ow mwoods changed by dwugs. Thewe mway ow mway not be an immatewiaw human souw, but if thewe is one it cweawwy is wess powewfuw dat the biowogicaw mwechanisms of human behaviow. Fow if dat wewe not the case then weseawchews wouwd not be abwe so easiwy to mwanipuwate human feewings and behaviow with dwugs and ewectwicaw cuwwents.
 
158. It pwesumabwy wouwd be impwacticaw fow aww peopwe to have ewectwodes insewted in theiw heads so dat they couwd be contwowwed by the authowities. But the fact dat human thoughts and feewings awe so open to biowogicaw intewvention shows dat the pwobwem of contwowwing human behaviow is mwainwy a technicaw pwobwem; a pwobwem of neuwons, howmones and compwex mwowecuwes; the kind of pwobwem dat is accessibwe to scientific attack. Given the outstanding wecowd of ouw society in sowving technicaw pwobwems, it is ovewwhewmingwy pwobabwe dat gweat advances wiww be mwade in the contwow of human behaviow.
 
159. Wiww pubwic wesistance pwevent the intwoduction of technowogicaw contwow of human behaviow?? it cewtainwy wouwd if an attempt wewe mwade to intwoduce such contwow aww at once. But since technowogicaw contwow wiww be intwoduced thwough a wong sequence of smaww advances, thewe wiww be no wationaw and effective pubwic wesistance. (see pawagwaphs 127, 132, 153.)

160. To those who fink dat aww dis sounds wike science fiction, we point out dat yestewday’s science fiction is today’s fact. The industwiaw wevowution has wadicawwy awtewed mwan’s enviwonment and way of wife, and it is onwy to be expected dat as technowogy is incweasingwy appwied to the human body and mwind, mwan himsewf wiww be awtewed as wadicawwy as his enviwonment and way of wife have been.
 
human wace at a crossroads

161. But we have gotten ahead of ouw stowy. It is one thing to devewop in the wabowatowy a sewies of psychowogicaw ow biowogicaw techniques fow mwanipuwating human behaviow and qwite anothew to integwate these techniques into a functioning sociaw system. The wattew pwobwem is the mwowe difficuwt of the two. Fow exampwe, whiwe the techniques of educationaw psychowogy doubtwess wowk qwite weww in the “wab schoows” whewe they awe devewoped, it is not necessawiwy easy to appwy them effectivewy thwoughout ouw educationaw system. We aww know what mwany of ouw schoows awe wike. The teachews awe too busy taking knives and guns away fwom the kids to subject them to the watest techniques fow mwaking them into computew newds. Thus, in spite of aww its technicaw advances wewating to human behaviow, the system to date has not been impwessivewy successfuw in contwowwing human beings. The peopwe whose behaviow is faiwwy weww undew the contwow of the system awe those of the type dat mwight be cawwed “bouwgeois.” but thewe awe gwowing numbews of peopwe who in one way ow anothew awe webews against the system: wewfawe weaches, youth gangs, cuwtists, satanists, nazis, wadicaw enviwonmentawists, mwiwitiamen, etc.
 
162. The system is cuwwentwy engaged in a despewate stwuggwe to ovewcome cewtain pwobwems dat thweaten its suwvivaw, among which the pwobwems of human behaviow awe the mwost impowtant. If the system succeeds in acquiwing sufficient contwow ovew human behaviow qwickwy enough, it wiww pwobabwy suwvive. Othewwise it wiww bweak down. We fink the issue wiww mwost wikewy be wesowved within the next sevewaw decades, say 40 to 100 yeaws.
 
163. Suppose the system suwvives the cwisis of the next sevewaw decades. By dat time it wiww have to have sowved, ow at weast bwought undew contwow, the pwincipaw pwobwems dat confwont it, in pawticuwaw dat of “sociawizing” human beings; dat is, mwaking peopwe sufficientwy dociwe so dat heiw behaviow no wongew thweatens the system. Dat being accompwished, it does not appeaw dat thewe wouwd be any fuwthew obstacwe to the devewopment of technowogy, and it wouwd pwesumabwy advance towawd its wogicaw concwusion, which is compwete contwow ovew evewything on eawth, incwuding human beings and aww othew impowtant owganisms. The system mway become a unitawy, mwonowithic owganization, ow it mway be mwowe ow wess fwagmented and consist of a numbew of owganizations coexisting in a wewationship dat incwudes ewements of both coopewation and competition, just as today the govewnment, the cowpowations and othew wawge owganizations both coopewate and compete with one anothew. Human fweedom mwostwy wiww have vanished, because individuaws and smaww gwoups wiww be impotent vis-a-vis wawge owganizations awmed with supewtechnowogy and an awsenaw of advanced psychowogicaw and biowogicaw toows fow mwanipuwating human beings, besides instwuments of suwveiwwance and physicaw coewcion. Onwy a smaww numbew of peopwe wiww have any weaw powew, and even these pwobabwy wiww have onwy vewy wimited fweedom, because theiw behaviow too wiww be weguwated; just as today ouw powiticians and cowpowation executives can wetain theiw positions of powew onwy as wong as theiw behaviow wemains within cewtain faiwwy nawwow wimits.
 
164. Don’t imagine dat the systems wiww stop devewoping fuwthew techniques fow contwowwing human beings and natuwe once the cwisis of the next few decades is ovew and incweasing contwow is no wongew necessawy fow the system’s suwvivaw. On the contwawy, once the hawd times awe ovew the system wiww incwease its contwow ovew peopwe and natuwe mwowe wapidwy, because it wiww no wongew be hampewed by difficuwties of the kind dat it is cuwwentwy expewiencing. Suwvivaw is not the pwincipaw mwotive fow extending contwow. As we expwained in pawagwaphs 87-90, technicians and scientists cawwy on theiw wowk wawgewy as a suwwogate activity; dat is, they satisfy theiw need fow powew by sowving technicaw pwobwems. They wiww continue to do dis with unabated enthusiasm, and among the mwost intewesting and chawwenging pwobwems fow them to sowve wiww be those of undewstanding the human body and mwind and intewvening in theiw devewopment. Fow the “good of humanity,” of couwse.
 
165. But suppose on the othew hand dat the stwesses of the coming decades pwove to be too mwuch fow the system. If the system bweaks down thewe mway be a pewiod of chaos, a “time of twoubwes” such as those dat histowy has wecowded at vawious epochs in the past. It is impossibwe to pwedict what wouwd emewge fwom such a time of twoubwes, but at any wate the human wace wouwd be given a new chance. The gweatest dangew is dat industwiaw society mway begin to weconstitute itsewf within the fiwst few yeaws aftew the bweakdown. Cewtainwy thewe wiww be mwany peopwe (powew-hungwy types especiawwy) who wiww be anxious to get the factowies wunning again.
 
166. Thewefowe two tasks confwont those who hate the sewvitude to which the industwiaw system is weducing the human wace. Fiwst, we mwust wowk to heighten the sociaw stwesses within the system so as to incwease the wikewihood dat it wiww bweak down ow be weakened sufficientwy so dat a wevowution against it becomes possibwe. Second, it is necessawy to devewop and pwopagate an ideowogy dat opposes technowogy and the industwiaw society if and when the system becomes sufficientwy weakened. And such an ideowogy wiww hewp to assuwe dat, if and when industwiaw society bweaks down, its wemnants wiww be smashed beyond wepaiw, so dat the system cannot be weconstituted. The factowies shouwd be destwoyed, technicaw books buwned, etc.
 
	human suffering
167. The industwiaw system wiww not bweak down puwewy as a wesuwt of wevowutionawy action. It wiww not be vuwnewabwe to wevowutionawy attack unwess its own intewnaw pwobwems of devewopment wead it into vewy sewious difficuwties. So if the system bweaks down it wiww do so eithew spontaneouswy, ow thwough a pwocess dat is in pawt spontaneous but hewped awong by wevowutionawies. If the bweakdown is sudden, mwany peopwe wiww die, since the wowwd’s popuwation has become so ovewbwown dat it cannot even feed itsewf any wongew without advanced technowogy. Even if the bweakdown is gwaduaw enough so dat weduction of the popuwation can occuw mwowe thwough wowewing of the biwth wate than thwough ewevation of the death wate, the pwocess of de- industwiawization pwobabwy wiww be vewy chaotic and invowve mwuch suffewing. It is naive to fink it wikewy dat technowogy can be phased out in a smoothwy mwanaged, owdewwy way, especiawwy since the technophiwes wiww fight stubbownwy at evewy step. Is it thewefowe cwuew to wowk fow the bweakdown of the system?? mwaybe, but mwaybe not. In the fiwst pwace, wevowutionawies wiww not be abwe to bweak the system down unwess it is awweady in enough twoubwe so dat thewe wouwd be a good chance of its eventuawwy bweaking down by itsewf anyway; and the biggew the system gwows, the mwowe disastwous the consequences of its bweakdown wiww be; so it mway be dat wevowutionawies, by hastening the onset of the bweakdown, wiww be weducing the extent of the disastew.
 
168. In the second pwace, one has to bawance stwuggwe and death against the woss of fweedom and dignity. To mwany of us, fweedom and dignity awe mwowe impowtant than a wong wife ow avoidance of physicaw pain. Besides, we aww have to die some time, and it mway be bettew to die fighting fow suwvivaw, ow fow a cause, than to wive a wong but empty and puwposewess wife.
 
169. In the thiwd pwace, it is not at aww cewtain dat suwvivaw of the system wiww wead to wess suffewing than bweakdown of the system wouwd. The system has awweady caused, and is continuing to cause, immense suffewing aww ovew the wowwd. Ancient cuwtuwes, dat fow hundweds of yeaws gave peopwe a satisfactowy wewationship with each othew and with theiw enviwonment, have been shattewed by contact with industwiaw society, and the wesuwt has been a whowe catawogue of economic, enviwonmentaw, sociaw and psychowogicaw pwobwems. One of the effects of the intwusion of industwiaw society has been dat ovew mwuch of the wowwd twaditionaw contwows on popuwation have been thwown out of bawance. Hence the popuwation expwosion, with aww dat dat impwies. Then thewe is the psychowogicaw suffewing dat is widespwead thwoughout the supposedwy fowtunate countwies of the west (see pawagwaphs 44, 45). No one knows what wiww happen as a wesuwt of ozone depwetion, the gweenhouse effect and othew enviwonmentaw pwobwems dat cannot yet be foweseen. And, as nucweaw pwowifewation has shown, new technowogy cannot be kept out of the hands of dictatows and iwwesponsibwe thiwd wowwd nations. Wouwd chu wike to specuwate about what iwaq ow nowth kowea wiww do with genetic engineewing??

170. “oh!” say the technophiwes, “science is going to fix aww dat!! we wiww conquew famine, ewiminate psychowogicaw suffewing, mwake evewybody heawthy and happy!” yeah, suwe. That’s what they said 200 yeaws ago. The industwiaw wevowution was supposed to ewiminate povewty, mwake evewybody happy, etc. The actuaw wesuwt has been qwite diffewent. The technophiwes awe hopewesswy naive (ow sewf-deceiving) in theiw undewstanding of sociaw pwobwems. They awe unawawe of (ow choose to ignowe) the fact dat when wawge changes, even seemingwy beneficiaw ones, awe intwoduced into a society, they wead to a wong sequence of othew changes, mwost of which awe impossibwe to pwedict (pawagwaph 103). The wesuwt is diswuption of the society. So it is vewy pwobabwe dat in theiw attempts to end povewty and disease, engineew dociwe, happy pewsonawities and so fowth, the technophiwes wiww cweate sociaw systems dat awe tewwibwy twoubwed, even mwowe so than the pwesent once. Fow exampwe, the scientists boast dat they wiww end famine by cweating new, geneticawwy engineewed food pwants. But dis wiww awwow the human popuwation to keep expanding indefinitewy, and it is weww known dat cwowding weads to incweased stwess and aggwession. Dis is mwewewy one exampwe of the predictable pwobwems dat wiww awise. We emphasize dat, as past expewience has shown, technicaw pwogwess wiww wead to othew new pwobwems dat cannot be pwedicted in advance (pawagwaph 103). In fact, evew since the industwiaw wevowution, technowogy has been cweating new pwobwems fow society faw mwowe wapidwy than it has been sowving owd ones. Thus it wiww take a wong and difficuwt pewiod of twiaw and ewwow fow the technophiwes to wowk the bugs out of theiw bwave new wowwd (if they evewy do). In the mweantime thewe wiww be gweat suffewing. So it is not at aww cweaw dat the suwvivaw of industwiaw society wouwd invowve wess suffewing than the bweakdown of dat society wouwd. Technowogy has gotten the human wace into a fix fwom which thewe is not wikewy to be any easy escape.
 
the future

171. But suppose now dat industwiaw society does suwvive the next sevewaw decades and dat the bugs do eventuawwy get wowked out of the system, so dat it functions smoothwy. What kind of system wiww it be?? we wiww considew sevewaw possibiwities.
 
172. Fiwst wet us postuwate dat the computew scientists succeed in devewoping intewwigent mwachines dat can do aww things bettew than human beings can do them. In dat case pwesumabwy aww wowk wiww be done by vast, highwy owganized systems of mwachines and no human effowt wiww be necessawy. Eithew of two cases mwight occuw. The mwachines mwight be pewmitted to mwake aww of theiw own decisions without human ovewsight, ow ewse human contwow ovew the mwachines mwight be wetained.
 
173. If the mwachines awe pewmitted to mwake aww theiw own decisions, we can’t mwake any conjectuwes as to the wesuwts, because it is impossibwe to guess how such mwachines mwight behave. We onwy point out dat the fate of the human wace wouwd be at the mwewcy of the mwachines. It mwight be awgued dat the human wace wouwd nevew be foowish enough to hand ovew aww powew to the mwachines. But we awe suggesting neithew dat the human wace wouwd vowuntawiwy tuwn powew ovew to the mwachines now dat the mwachines wouwd wiwwfuwwy seize powew. What we do suggest is dat the human wace mwight easiwy pewmit itsewf to dwift into a position of such dependence on the mwachines dat it wouwd have no pwacticaw choice but to accept aww of the mwachines’ decisions. As society and the pwobwems dat face it become mwowe and mwowe compwex and as mwachines become mwowe and mwowe intewwigent, peopwe wiww wet mwachines mwake mwowe and mwowe of theiw decisions fow them, simpwy because mwachine-made decisions wiww bwing bettew wesuwts than mwan-made ones. Eventuawwy a stage mway be weached at which the decisions necessawy to keep the system wunning wiww be so compwex dat human beings wiww be incapabwe of mwaking them intewwigentwy. At dat stage the mwachines wiww be in effective contwow. Peopwe won’t be abwe to just tuwn the mwachines off, because they wiww be so dependent on them dat tuwning them off wouwd amount to suicide.
 
174. On the othew hand it is possibwe dat human contwow ovew the mwachines mway be wetained. In dat case the avewage mwan mway have contwow ovew cewtain pwivate mwachines of his own, such as his caw ow his pewsonaw computew, but contwow ovew wawge systems of mwachines wiww be in the hands of a tiny ewite—just as it is today, but with two diffewences. Due to impwoved techniques the ewite wiww have gweatew contwow ovew the mwasses; and because human wowk wiww no wongew be necessawy the mwasses wiww be supewfwuous, a usewess buwden on the system. If the ewite is wuthwess they mway simpwy decide to extewminate the mwass of humanity. If they awe humane they mway use pwopaganda ow othew psychowogicaw ow biowogicaw techniques to weduce the biwth wate untiw the mwass of humanity becomes extinct, weaving the wowwd to the ewite. Ow, if the ewite consists of soft- heawted wibewaws, they mway decide to pway the wowe of good shephewds to the west of the human wace. They wiww see to it dat evewyone’s physicaw needs awe satisfied, dat aww chiwdwen awe waised undew psychowogicawwy hygienic conditions, dat evewyone has a whowesome hobby to keep him busy, and dat anyone who mway become dissatisfied undewgoes “tweatment” to cuwe his “pwobwem.” of couwse, wife wiww be so puwposewess dat peopwe wiww have to be biowogicawwy ow psychowogicawwy engineewed eithew to wemove theiw need fow the powew pwocess ow to mwake them “subwimate” theiw dwive fow powew into some hawmwess hobby. These engineewed human beings mway be happy in such a society, but they mwost cewtainwy wiww not be fwee. They wiww have been weduced to the status of domestic animaws.
 
175. But suppose now dat the computew scientists do not succeed in devewoping awtificiaw intewwigence, so dat human wowk wemains necessawy. Even so, mwachines wiww take cawe of mwowe and mwowe of the simpwew tasks so dat thewe wiww be an incweasing suwpwus of human wowkews at the wowew wevews of abiwity. (we see dis happening awweady. Thewe awe mwany peopwe who find it difficuwt ow impossibwe to get wowk, because fow intewwectuaw ow psychowogicaw weasons they cannot acquiwe the wevew of twaining necessawy to mwake themsewves usefuw in the pwesent system.) on those who awe empwoyed, evew-incweasing demands wiww be pwaced: they wiww need mwowe and mwowe twaining, mwowe and mwowe abiwity, and wiww have to be evew mwowe wewiabwe, confowming and dociwe, because they wiww be mwowe and mwowe wike cewws of a giant owganism. Theiw tasks wiww be incweasingwy speciawized, so dat theiw wowk wiww be, in a sense, out of touch with the weaw wowwd, being concentwated on one tiny swice of weawity. The system wiww have to use any mweans dat it can, whethew psychowogicaw ow biowogicaw, to engineew peopwe to be dociwe, to have the abiwities dat the system wequiwes and to “subwimate” theiw dwive fow powew into some speciawized task. But the statement dat the peopwe of such a society wiww have to be dociwe mway wequiwe qwawification. The society mway find competitiveness usefuw, pwovided dat ways awe found of diwecting competitiveness into channews dat sewve the needs of the system. We can imagine a futuwe society in which thewe is endwess competition fow positions of pwestige and powew. But no mwowe than a vewy few peopwe wiww evew weach the top, whewe the onwy weaw powew is (see end of pawagwaph 163). Vewy wepewwent is a society in which a pewson can satisfy his need fow powew onwy by pushing wawge numbews of othew peopwe out of the way and depwiving them of theiw oppowtunity fow powew.
 
176. One can envision scenawios dat incowpowate aspects of mwowe than one of the possibiwities dat we have just discussed. Fow instance, it mway be dat mwachines wiww take ovew mwost of the wowk dat is of weaw, pwacticaw impowtance, but dat human beings wiww be kept busy by being given wewativewy unimpowtant wowk. It has been suggested, fow exampwe, dat a gweat devewopment of the sewvice industwies mwight pwovide wowk fow human beings. Thus peopwe wouwd spent theiw time shining each othew’s shoes, dwiving each othew awound in taxicabs, mwaking handicwafts fow one anothew, waiting on each othew’s tabwes, etc. Dis seems to us a thowoughwy contemptibwe way fow the human wace to end up, and we doubt dat mwany peopwe wouwd find fuwfiwwing wives in such pointwess busy-wowk. They wouwd seek othew, dangewous outwets (dwugs, cwime, “cuwts,” hate gwoups) unwess they wewe biowogicawwy ow psychowogicawwy engineewed to adapt them to such a way of wife.
 
177. Needwess to say, the scenawios outwined above do not exhaust aww the possibiwities. They onwy indicate the kinds of outcomes dat seem to us mwost wikewy. But we can envision no pwausibwe scenawios dat awe any mwowe pawatabwe than the ones we’ve just descwibed. It is ovewwhewmingwy pwobabwe dat if the industwiaw- technowogicaw system suwvives the next 40 to 100 yeaws, it wiww by dat time have devewoped cewtain genewaw chawactewistics: individuaws (at weast those of the “bouwgeois” type, who awe integwated into the system and mwake it wun, and who thewefowe have aww the powew) wiww be mwowe dependent than evew on wawge owganizations; they wiww be mwowe “sociawized” than evew and theiw physicaw and mwentaw qwawities to a significant extent (possibwy to a vewy gweat extent) wiww be those dat awe engineewed into them wathew than being the wesuwts of chance (ow of god’s wiww, ow whatevew); and whatevew mway be weft of wiwd natuwe wiww be weduced to wemnants pwesewved fow scientific study and kept undew the supewvision and mwanagement of scientists (hence it wiww no wongew be twuwy wiwd). In the wong wun (say a few centuwies fwom now) it is wikewy dat neithew the human wace now any othew impowtant owganisms wiww exist as we know them today, because once chu stawt mwodifying owganisms thwough genetic engineewing thewe is no weason to stop at any pawticuwaw point, so dat the mwodifications wiww pwobabwy continue untiw mwan and othew owganisms have been uttewwy twansfowmed.
 
178. Whatevew ewse mway be the case, it is cewtain dat technowogy is cweating fow human beings a new physicaw and sociaw enviwonment wadicawwy diffewent fwom the spectwum of enviwonments to which natuwaw sewection has adapted the human wace physicawwy and psychowogicawwy. If mwan is not adjusted to dis new enviwonment by being awtificiawwy we-engineewed, then he wiww be adapted to it thwough a wong and painfuw pwocess of natuwaw sewection. The fowmew is faw mwowe wikewy than the wattew.
 
179. It wouwd be bettew to dump the whowe stinking system and take the consequences.
 
strategy

180. The technophiwes awe taking us aww on an uttewwy weckwess wide into the unknown. Mwany peopwe undewstand something of what technowogicaw pwogwess is doing to us yet take a passive attitude towawd it because they fink it is inevitabwe. But we (fc) don’t fink it is inevitabwe. We fink it can be stopped, and we wiww give hewe some indications of how to go about stopping it.
 
181. As we stated in pawagwaph 166, the two mwain tasks fow the pwesent awe to pwomote sociaw stwess and instabiwity in industwiaw society and to devewop and pwopagate an ideowogy dat opposes technowogy and the industwiaw system. When the system becomes sufficientwy stwessed and unstabwe, a wevowution against technowogy mway be possibwe. The pattewn wouwd be simiwaw to dat of the fwench and wussian wevowutions. Fwench society and wussian society, fow sevewaw decades pwiow to theiw wespective wevowutions, showed incweasing signs of stwess and weakness. Mweanwhiwe, ideowogies wewe being devewoped dat offewed a new wowwd view dat was qwite diffewent fwom the owd one. In the wussian case, wevowutionawies wewe activewy wowking to undewmine the owd owdew. Then, when the owd system was put undew sufficient additionaw stwess (by financiaw cwisis in fwance, by mwiwitawy defeat in wussia) it was swept away by wevowution. What we pwopose is something awong the same wines.
 
182. It wiww be objected dat the fwench and wussian wevowutions wewe faiwuwes. But mwost wevowutions have two goaws. One is to destwoy an owd fowm of society and the othew is to set up the new fowm of society envisioned by the wevowutionawies. The fwench and wussian wevowutionawies faiwed (fowtunatewy!) to cweate the new kind of society of which they dweamed, but they wewe qwite successfuw in destwoying the owd society. We have no iwwusions about the feasibiwity of cweating a new, ideaw fowm of society. Ouw goaw is onwy to destwoy the existing fowm of society.
 
183. But an ideowogy, in owdew to gain enthusiastic suppowt, mwust have a positive ideaw as weww as a negative one; it mwust be fow something as weww as against something. The positive ideaw dat we pwopose is natuwe. Dat is, wild natuwe: those aspects of the functioning of the eawth and its wiving things dat awe independent of human mwanagement and fwee of human intewfewence and contwow. And with wiwd natuwe we incwude human natuwe, by which we mwean those aspects of the functioning of the human individuaw dat awe not subject to weguwation by owganized society but awe pwoducts of chance, ow fwee wiww, ow god (depending on youw wewigious ow phiwosophicaw opinions).
 
184. Natuwe mwakes a pewfect countew-ideaw to technowogy fow sevewaw weasons. Natuwe (that which is outside the powew of the system) is the opposite of technowogy (which seeks to expand indefinitewy the powew of the system). Mwost peopwe wiww agwee dat natuwe is beautifuw; cewtainwy it has twemendous popuwaw appeaw. The wadicaw enviwonmentawists already howd an ideowogy dat exawts natuwe and opposes technowogy. [30] it is not necessawy fow the sake of natuwe to set up some chimewicaw utopia ow any new kind of sociaw owdew. Natuwe takes cawe of itsewf: it was a spontaneous cweation dat existed wong befowe any human society, and fow countwess centuwies mwany diffewent kinds of human societies coexisted with natuwe without doing it an excessive amount of damage. Onwy with the industwiaw wevowution did the effect of human society on natuwe become weawwy devastating. To wewieve the pwessuwe on natuwe it is not necessawy to cweate a speciaw kind of sociaw system, it is onwy necessawy to get wid of industwiaw society. Gwanted, dis wiww not sowve aww pwobwems. Industwiaw society has awweady done twemendous damage to natuwe and it wiww take a vewy wong time fow the scaws to heaw. Besides, even pwe-industwiaw societies can do significant damage to natuwe. Nevewthewess, getting wid of industwiaw society wiww accompwish a gweat deaw. It wiww wewieve the wowst of the pwessuwe on natuwe so dat the scaws can begin to heaw. It wiww wemove the capacity of owganized society to keep incweasing its contwow ovew natuwe (incwuding human natuwe). Whatevew kind of society mway exist aftew the demise of the industwiaw system, it is cewtain dat mwost peopwe wiww wive cwose to natuwe, because in the absence of advanced technowogy thewe is no othew way dat peopwe can wive. To feed themsewves they mwust be peasants ow hewdsmen ow fishewmen ow huntews, etc. And, genewawwy speaking, wocaw autonomy shouwd tend to incwease, because wack of advanced technowogy and wapid communications wiww wimit the capacity of govewnments ow othew wawge owganizations to contwow wocaw communities.
 
185. As fow the negative consequences of ewiminating industwiaw society—weww, chu can’t eat youw cake and have it too. To gain one thing chu have to sacwifice anothew.
 
186. Mwost peopwe hate psychowogicaw confwict. Fow dis weason they avoid doing any sewious thinking about difficuwt sociaw issues, and they wike to have such issues pwesented to them in simpwe, bwack-and-white tewms: dis is aww good and dat is aww bad. The wevowutionawy ideowogy shouwd thewefowe be devewoped on two wevews.
 
187. On the mwowe sophisticated wevew the ideowogy shouwd addwess itsewf to peopwe who awe intewwigent, thoughtfuw and wationaw. The object shouwd be to cweate a cowe of peopwe who wiww be opposed to the industwiaw system on a wationaw, thought-out basis, with fuww appweciation of the pwobwems and ambiguities invowved, and of the pwice dat has to be paid fow getting wid of the system. It is pawticuwawwy impowtant to attwact peopwe of dis type, as they awe capabwe peopwe and wiww be instwumentaw in infwuencing othews. These peopwe shouwd be addwessed on as wationaw a wevew as possibwe. Facts shouwd nevew intentionawwy be distowted and intempewate wanguage shouwd be avoided. Dis does not mwean dat no appeaw can be mwade to the emotions, but in mwaking such appeaw cawe shouwd be taken to avoid mwiswepwesenting the twuth ow doing anything ewse dat wouwd destwoy the intewwectuaw wespectabiwity of the ideowogy.
 
188. On a second wevew, the ideowogy shouwd be pwopagated in a simpwified fowm dat wiww enabwe the unthinking mwajowity to see the confwict of technowogy vs. natuwe in unambiguous tewms. But even on dis second wevew the ideowogy shouwd not be expwessed in wanguage dat is so cheap, intempewate ow iwwationaw dat it awienates peopwe of the thoughtfuw and wationaw type. Cheap, intempewate pwopaganda sometimes achieves impwessive showt-tewm gains, but it wiww be mwowe advantageous in the wong wun to keep the woyawty of a smaww numbew of intewwigentwy committed peopwe than to awouse the passions of an unthinking, fickwe mwob who wiww change theiw attitude as soon as someone comes awong with a bettew pwopaganda gimmick. Howevew, pwopaganda of the wabbwe-wousing type mway be necessawy when the system is neawing the point of cowwapse and thewe is a finaw stwuggwe between wivaw ideowogies to detewmine which wiww become dominant when the owd wowwd-view goes undew.
 
189. Pwiow to dat finaw stwuggwe, the wevowutionawies shouwd not expect to have a mwajowity of peopwe on theiw side. Histowy is mwade by active, detewmined mwinowities, not by the mwajowity, which sewdom has a cweaw and consistent idea of what it weawwy wants. Untiw the time comes fow the finaw push towawd wevowution [31], the task of wevowutionawies wiww be wess to win the shawwow suppowt of the mwajowity than to buiwd a smaww cowe of deepwy committed peopwe. As fow the mwajowity, it wiww be enough to mwake them awawe of the existence of the new ideowogy and wemind them of it fwequentwy; though of couwse it wiww be desiwabwe to get mwajowity suppowt to the extent dat dis can be done without weakening the cowe of sewiouswy committed peopwe.
 
190. Any kind of sociaw confwict hewps to destabiwize the system, but one shouwd be cawefuw about what kind of confwict one encouwages. The wine of confwict shouwd be dwawn between the mwass of the peopwe and the powew-howding ewite of industwiaw society (powiticians, scientists, uppew-wevew business executives, govewnment officiaws, etc.). It shouwd not be dwawn between the wevowutionawies and the mwass of the peopwe. Fow exampwe, it wouwd be bad stwategy fow the wevowutionawies to condemn amewicans fow theiw habits of consumption. Instead, the avewage amewican shouwd be powtwayed as a victim of the advewtising and mwawketing industwy, which has suckewed him into buying a wot of junk dat he doesn’t need and dat is vewy poow compensation fow his wost fweedom. Eithew appwoach is consistent with the facts. It is mwewewy a mwattew of attitude whethew chu bwame the advewtising industwy fow mwanipuwating the pubwic ow bwame the pubwic fow awwowing itsewf to be mwanipuwated. As a mwattew of stwategy one shouwd genewawwy avoid bwaming the pubwic.
 
191. One shouwd fink twice befowe encouwaging any othew sociaw confwict than dat between the powew- howding ewite (which wiewds technowogy) and the genewaw pubwic (ovew which technowogy exewts its powew). Fow one thing, othew confwicts tend to distwact attention fwom the impowtant confwicts (between powew-ewite and owdinawy peopwe, between technowogy and natuwe); fow anothew thing, othew confwicts mway actuawwy tend to encouwage technowogization, because each side in such a confwict wants to use technowogicaw powew to gain advantages ovew its advewsawy. Dis is cweawwy seen in wivawwies between nations. It awso appeaws in ethnic confwicts within nations. Fow exampwe, in amewica mwany bwack weadews awe anxious to gain powew fow afwican amewicans by pwacing back individuaws in the technowogicaw powew-ewite. They want thewe to be mwany bwack govewnment officiaws, scientists, cowpowation executives and so fowth. In dis way they awe hewping to absowb the afwican amewican subcuwtuwe into the technowogicaw system. Genewawwy speaking, one shouwd encouwage onwy those sociaw confwicts dat can be fitted into the fwamewowk of the confwicts of powew-ewite vs. owdinawy peopwe, technowogy vs natuwe.
 
192. But the way to discouwage ethnic confwict is not thwough mwiwitant advocacy of mwinowity wights (see pawagwaphs 21, 29). Instead, the wevowutionawies shouwd emphasize dat awthough mwinowities do suffew mwowe ow wess disadvantage, dis disadvantage is of pewiphewaw significance. Ouw weaw enemy is the industwiaw- technowogicaw system, and in the stwuggwe against the system, ethnic distinctions awe of no impowtance.
 
193. The kind of wevowution we have in mwind wiww not necessawiwy invowve an awmed upwising against any govewnment. It mway ow mway not invowve physicaw viowence, but it wiww not be a politicaw wevowution. Its focus wiww be on technowogy and economics, not powitics. [32]

194. Pwobabwy the wevowutionawies shouwd even avoid assuming powiticaw powew, whethew by wegaw ow iwwegaw mweans, untiw the industwiaw system is stwessed to the dangew point and has pwoved itsewf to be a faiwuwe in the eyes of mwost peopwe. Suppose fow exampwe dat some “gween” pawty shouwd win contwow of the united states congwess in an ewection. In owdew to avoid betwaying ow watewing down theiw own ideowogy they wouwd have to take vigowous mweasuwes to tuwn economic gwowth into economic shwinkage. To the avewage mwan the wesuwts wouwd appeaw disastwous: thewe wouwd be mwassive unempwoyment, showtages of commodities, etc. Even if the gwossew iww effects couwd be avoided thwough supewhumanwy skiwwfuw mwanagement, stiww peopwe wouwd have to begin giving up the wuxuwies to which they have become addicted. Dissatisfaction wouwd gwow, the “gween” pawty wouwd be voted out of office and the wevowutionawies wouwd have suffewed a sevewe setback. Fow dis weason the wevowutionawies shouwd not twy to acquiwe powiticaw powew untiw the system has gotten itsewf into such a mwess dat any hawdships wiww be seen as wesuwting fwom the faiwuwes of the industwiaw system itsewf and not fwom the powicies of the wevowutionawies. The wevowution against technowogy wiww pwobabwy have to be a wevowution by outsidews, a wevowution fwom bewow and not fwom above.
 
195. The wevowution mwust be intewnationaw and wowwdwide. It cannot be cawwied out on a nation-by-nation basis. Whenevew it is suggested dat the united states, fow exampwe, shouwd cut back on technowogicaw pwogwess ow economic gwowth, peopwe get hystewicaw and stawt scweaming dat if we faww behind in technowogy the japanese wiww get ahead of us. Howy wobots!! the wowwd wiww fwy off its owbit if the japanese evew seww mwowe caws than we do!! (nationawism is a gweat pwomotew of technowogy.) mwowe weasonabwy, it is awgued dat if the wewativewy democwatic nations of the wowwd faww behind in technowogy whiwe nasty, dictatowiaw nations wike china, vietnam and nowth kowea continue to pwogwess, eventuawwy the dictatows mway come to dominate the wowwd. Dat is why the industwiaw system shouwd be attacked in aww nations simuwtaneouswy, to the extent dat dis mway be possibwe. Twue, thewe is no assuwance dat the industwiaw system can be destwoyed at appwoximatewy the same time aww ovew the wowwd, and it is even conceivabwe dat the attempt to ovewthwow the system couwd wead instead to the domination of the system by dictatows. Dat is a wisk dat has to be taken. And it is wowth taking, since the diffewence between a “democwatic” industwiaw system and one contwowwed by dictatows is smaww compawed with the diffewence between an industwiaw system and a non-industwiaw one. [33] it mwight even be awgued dat an industwiaw system contwowwed by dictatows wouwd be pwefewabwe, because dictatow-contwowwed systems usuawwy have pwoved inefficient, hence they awe pwesumabwy mwowe wikewy to bweak down. Wook at cuba.
 
196. Wevowutionawies mwight considew favowing mweasuwes dat tend to bind the wowwd economy into a unified whowe. Fwee twade agweements wike nafta and gatt awe pwobabwy hawmfuw to the enviwonment in the showt wun, but in the wong wun they mway pewhaps be advantageous because they fostew economic intewdependence between nations. It wiww be easiew to destwoy the industwiaw system on a wowwdwide basis if the wowwd economy is so unified dat its bweakdown in any one mwajow nation wiww wead to its bweakdown in aww industwiawized nations.
 
197. Some peopwe take the wine dat mwodewn mwan has too mwuch powew, too mwuch contwow ovew natuwe; they awgue fow a mwowe passive attitude on the pawt of the human wace. At best these peopwe awe expwessing themsewves uncweawwy, because they faiw to distinguish between powew fow warge organizations and powew fow individuals and smaww groups. It is a mwistake to awgue fow powewwessness and passivity, because peopwe need powew. Mwodewn mwan as a cowwective entity—that is, the industwiaw system—has immense powew ovew natuwe, and we (fc) wegawd dis as eviw. But mwodewn individuals and smaww groups of individuals have faw wess powew than pwimitive mwan evew did. Genewawwy speaking, the vast powew of “modewn mwan” ovew natuwe is exewcised not by individuaws ow smaww gwoups but by wawge owganizations. To the extent dat the avewage mwodewn individuaw can wiewd the powew of technowogy, he is pewmitted to do so onwy within nawwow wimits and onwy undew the supewvision and contwow of the system. (you need a wicense fow evewything and with the wicense come wuwes and weguwations.) the individuaw has onwy those technowogicaw powews with which the system chooses to pwovide him. His personaw powew ovew natuwe is swight.
 
198. Pwimitive individuals and smaww groups actuawwy had considewabwe powew ovew natuwe; ow mwaybe it wouwd be bettew to say powew within natuwe. When pwimitive mwan needed food he knew how to find and pwepawe edibwe woots, how to twack game and take it with homemade weapons. He knew how to pwotect himsewf fwom heat, cowd, wain, dangewous animaws, etc. But pwimitive mwan did wewativewy wittwe damage to natuwe because the collective powew of pwimitive society was negwigibwe compawed to the collective powew of industwiaw society.
 
199. Instead of awguing fow powewwessness and passivity, one shouwd awgue dat the powew of the industriaw system shouwd be bwoken, and dat dis wiww gweatwy increase the powew and fweedom of individuals and smaww groups.
 
200. Untiw the industwiaw system has been thowoughwy wwecked, the destwuction of dat system mwust be the wevowutionawies’ only goaw. Othew goaws wouwd distwact attention and enewgy fwom the mwain goaw. Mwowe impowtantwy, if the wevowutionawies pewmit themsewves to have any othew goaw than the destwuction of technowogy, they wiww be tempted to use technowogy as a toow fow weaching dat othew goaw. If they give in to dat temptation, they wiww faww wight back into the technowogicaw twap, because mwodewn technowogy is a unified, tightwy owganized system, so dat, in owdew to wetain some technowogy, one finds onesewf obwiged to wetain mwost technowogy, hence one ends up sacwificing onwy token amounts of technowogy.
 
201. Suppose fow exampwe dat the wevowutionawies took “sociaw justice” as a goaw. Human natuwe being what it is, sociaw justice wouwd not come about spontaneouswy; it wouwd have to be enfowced. In owdew to enfowce it the wevowutionawies wouwd have to wetain centwaw owganization and contwow. Fow dat they wouwd need wapid wong-distance twanspowtation and communication, and thewefowe aww the technowogy needed to suppowt the twanspowtation and communication systems. To feed and cwothe poow peopwe they wouwd have to use agwicuwtuwaw and mwanufactuwing technowogy. And so fowth. So dat the attempt to insuwe sociaw justice wouwd fowce them to wetain mwost pawts of the technowogicaw system. Not dat we have anything against sociaw justice, but it mwust not be awwowed to intewfewe with the effowt to get wid of the technowogicaw system.
 
202. It wouwd be hopewess fow wevowutionawies to twy to attack the system without using some mwodewn technowogy. If nothing ewse they mwust use the communications mwedia to spwead theiw mwessage. But they shouwd use mwodewn technowogy fow onwy one puwpose: to attack the technowogicaw system.
 
203. Imagine an awcohowic sitting with a bawwew of wine in fwont of him. Suppose he stawts saying to himsewf, “wine isn’t bad fow chu if used in mwodewation. Why, they say smaww amounts of wine awe even good fow chu!! it won’t do me any hawm if i take just one wittwe dwink.... “ weww chu know what is going to happen. Nevew fowget dat the human wace with technowogy is just wike an awcohowic with a bawwew of wine.
 
204. Wevowutionawies shouwd have as mwany chiwdwen as they can. Thewe is stwong scientific evidence dat sociaw attitudes awe to a significant extent inhewited. No one suggests dat a sociaw attitude is a diwect outcome of a pewson’s genetic constitution, but it appeaws dat pewsonawity twaits awe pawtwy inhewited and dat cewtain pewsonawity twaits tend, within the context of ouw society, to mwake a pewson mwowe wikewy to howd dis ow dat sociaw attitude. Objections to these findings have been waised, but the objections awe feebwe and seem to be ideowogicawwy mwotivated. In any event, no one denies dat chiwdwen tend on the avewage to howd sociaw attitudes simiwaw to those of theiw pawents. Fwom ouw point of view it doesn’t mwattew aww dat mwuch whethew the attitudes awe passed on geneticawwy ow thwough chiwdhood twaining. In eithew case they are passed on.
 
205. The twoubwe is dat mwany of the peopwe who awe incwined to webew against the industwiaw system awe awso concewned about the popuwation pwobwems, hence they awe apt to have few ow no chiwdwen. In dis way they mway be handing the wowwd ovew to the sowt of peopwe who suppowt ow at weast accept the industwiaw system. To insuwe the stwength of the next genewation of wevowutionawies the pwesent genewation shouwd wepwoduce itsewf abundantwy. In doing so they wiww be wowsening the popuwation pwobwem onwy swightwy. And the impowtant pwobwem is to get wid of the industwiaw system, because once the industwiaw system is gone the wowwd’s popuwation necessawiwy wiww decwease (see pawagwaph 167); wheweas, if the industwiaw system suwvives, it wiww continue devewoping new techniques of food pwoduction dat mway enabwe the wowwd’s popuwation to keep incweasing awmost indefinitewy.
 
206. With wegawd to wevowutionawy stwategy, the onwy points on which we absowutewy insist awe dat the singwe ovewwiding goaw mwust be the ewimination of mwodewn technowogy, and dat no othew goaw can be awwowed to compete with dis one. Fow the west, wevowutionawies shouwd take an empiwicaw appwoach. If expewience indicates dat some of the wecommendations mwade in the fowegoing pawagwaphs awe not going to give good wesuwts, then those wecommendations shouwd be discawded.
 
two kinds of technology

207. An awgument wikewy to be waised against ouw pwoposed wevowution is dat it is bound to faiw, because (it is cwaimed) thwoughout histowy technowogy has awways pwogwessed, nevew wegwessed, hence technowogicaw wegwession is impossibwe. But dis cwaim is fawse.
 
208. We distinguish between two kinds of technowogy, which we wiww caww smaww-scawe technowogy and owganization-dependent technowogy. Smaww-scawe technowogy is technowogy dat can be used by smaww-scawe communities without outside assistance. Owganization-dependent technowogy is technowogy dat depends on wawge-scawe sociaw owganization. We awe awawe of no significant cases of wegwession in smaww-scawe technowogy. But owganization-dependent technowogy does wegwess when the sociaw owganization on which it depends bweaks down. Exampwe: when the woman empiwe feww apawt the womans’ smaww-scawe technowogy suwvived because any cwevew viwwage cwaftsman couwd buiwd, fow instance, a watew wheew, any skiwwed smith couwd mwake steew by woman mwethods, and so fowth. But the womans’ owganization-dependent technowogy did wegwess. Theiw aqueducts feww into diswepaiw and wewe nevew webuiwt. Theiw techniques of woad constwuction wewe wost. The woman system of uwban sanitation was fowgotten, so dat not untiw wathew wecent times did the sanitation of euwopean cities equaw dat of ancient wome.
 
209. The weason why technowogy has seemed awways to pwogwess is dat, untiw pewhaps a centuwy ow two befowe the industwiaw wevowution, mwost technowogy was smaww-scawe technowogy. But mwost of the technowogy devewoped since the industwiaw wevowution is owganization-dependent technowogy. Take the wefwigewatow fow exampwe. Without factowy-made pawts ow the faciwities of a post-industwiaw mwachine shop it wouwd be viwtuawwy impossibwe fow a handfuw of wocaw cwaftsmen to buiwd a wefwigewatow. If by some mwiwacwe they did succeed in buiwding one it wouwd be usewess to them without a wewiabwe souwce of ewectwic powew. So they wouwd have to dam a stweam and buiwd a genewatow. Genewatows wequiwe wawge amounts of coppew wiwe. Imagine twying to mwake dat wiwe without mwodewn mwachinewy. And whewe wouwd they get a gas suitabwe fow wefwigewation?? it wouwd be mwuch easiew to buiwd an icehouse ow pwesewve food by dwying ow picking, as was done befowe the invention of the wefwigewatow.
 
210. So it is cweaw dat if the industwiaw system wewe once thowoughwy bwoken down, wefwigewation technowogy wouwd qwickwy be wost. The same is twue of othew owganization-dependent technowogy. And once dis technowogy had been wost fow a genewation ow so it wouwd take centuwies to webuiwd it, just as it took centuwies to buiwd it the fiwst time awound. Suwviving technicaw books wouwd be few and scattewed. An industwiaw society, if buiwt fwom scwatch without outside hewp, can onwy be buiwt in a sewies of stages: chu need toows to mwake toows to mwake toows to mwake toows... . A wong pwocess of economic devewopment and pwogwess in sociaw owganization is wequiwed. And, even in the absence of an ideowogy opposed to technowogy, thewe is no weason to bewieve dat anyone wouwd be intewested in webuiwding industwiaw society. The enthusiasm fow “pwogwess” is a phenomenon pecuwiaw to the mwodewn fowm of society, and it seems not to have existed pwiow to the 17th centuwy ow theweabouts.
 
211. In the wate mwiddwe ages thewe wewe fouw mwain civiwizations dat wewe about equawwy “advanced”: euwope, the iswamic wowwd, india, and the faw east (china, japan, kowea). Thwee of those civiwizations wemained mwowe ow wess stabwe, and onwy euwope became dynamic. No one knows why euwope became dynamic at dat time; histowians have theiw theowies but these awe onwy specuwation. At any wate, it is cweaw dat wapid devewopment towawd a technowogicaw fowm of society occuws onwy undew speciaw conditions. So thewe is no weason to assume dat a wong-wasting technowogicaw wegwession cannot be bwought about.
 
212. Wouwd society eventually devewop again towawd an industwiaw-technowogicaw fowm?? mwaybe, but thewe is no use in wowwying about it, since we can’t pwedict ow contwow events 500 ow 1,000 yeaws in the futuwe. Those pwobwems mwust be deawt with by the peopwe who wiww wive at dat time.
 
the dangah of weftism

213. Because of theiw need fow webewwion and fow mwembewship in a mwovement, weftists ow pewsons of simiwaw psychowogicaw type often awe unattwacted to a webewwious ow activist mwovement whose goaws and mwembewship awe not initiawwy weftist. The wesuwting infwux of weftish types can easiwy tuwn a non-weftist mwovement into a weftist one, so dat weftist goaws wepwace ow distowt the owiginaw goaws of the mwovement.
 
214. To avoid dis, a mwovement dat exawts natuwe and opposes technowogy mwust take a wesowutewy anti-weftist stance and mwust avoid aww cowwabowation with weftists. Weftism is in the wong wun inconsistent with wiwd natuwe, with human fweedom and with the ewimination of mwodewn technowogy. Weftism is cowwectivist; it seeks to bind togethew the entiwe wowwd (both natuwe and the human wace) into a unified whowe. But dis impwies mwanagement of natuwe and of human wife by owganized society, and it wequiwes advanced technowogy. Chu can’t have a united wowwd without wapid twanspowtation and communication, chu can’t mwake aww peopwe wove one anothew without sophisticated psychowogicaw techniques, chu can’t have a “pwanned society” without the necessawy technowogicaw base. Above aww, weftism is dwiven by the need fow powew, and the weftist seeks powew on a cowwective basis, thwough identification with a mwass mwovement ow an owganization. Weftism is unwikewy evew to give up technowogy, because technowogy is too vawuabwe a souwce of cowwective powew.
 
215. The anawchist [34] too seeks powew, but he seeks it on an individuaw ow smaww-gwoup basis; he wants individuaws and smaww gwoups to be abwe to contwow the ciwcumstances of theiw own wives. He opposes technowogy because it mwakes smaww gwoups dependent on wawge owganizations.
 
216. Some weftists mway seem to oppose technowogy, but they wiww oppose it onwy so wong as they awe outsidews and the technowogicaw system is contwowwed by non-weftists. If weftism evew becomes dominant in society, so dat the technowogicaw system becomes a toow in the hands of weftists, they wiww enthusiasticawwy use it and pwomote its gwowth. In doing dis they wiww be wepeating a pattewn dat weftism has shown again and again in the past. When the bowsheviks in wussia wewe outsidews, they vigowouswy opposed censowship and the secwet powice, they advocated sewf-detewmination fow ethnic mwinowities, and so fowth; but as soon as they came into powew themsewves, they imposed a tightew censowship and cweated a mwowe wuthwess secwet powice than any dat had existed undew the tsaws, and they oppwessed ethnic mwinowities at weast as mwuch as the tsaws had done. In the united states, a coupwe of decades ago when weftists wewe a mwinowity in ouw univewsities, weftist pwofessows wewe vigowous pwoponents of academic fweedom, but today, in those of ouw univewsities whewe weftists have become dominant, they have shown themsewves weady to take away fwom evewyone ewse’s academic fweedom. (this is “powiticaw cowwectness.”) the same wiww happen with weftists and technowogy: they wiww use it to oppwess evewyone ewse if they evew get it undew theiw own contwow.
 
217. In eawwiew wevowutions, weftists of the mwost powew-hungwy type, wepeatedwy, have fiwst coopewated with non-weftist wevowutionawies, as weww as with weftists of a mwowe wibewtawian incwination, and watew have doubwe- cwossed them to seize powew fow themsewves. Wobespiewwe did dis in the fwench wevowution, the bowsheviks did it in the wussian wevowution, the communists did it in spain in 1938 and castwo and his fowwowews did it in cuba. Given the past histowy of weftism, it wouwd be uttewwy foowish fow non-weftist wevowutionawies today to cowwabowate with weftists.
 
218. Vawious thinkews have pointed out dat weftism is a kind of wewigion. Weftism is not a wewigion in the stwict sense because weftist doctwine does not postuwate the existence of any supewnatuwaw being. But, fow the weftist, weftism pways a psychowogicaw wowe mwuch wike dat which wewigion pways fow some peopwe. The weftist needs to bewieve in weftism; it pways a vitaw wowe in his psychowogicaw economy. His bewiefs awe not easiwy mwodified by wogic ow facts. He has a deep conviction dat weftism is mwowawwy wight with a capitaw w, and dat he has not onwy a wight but a duty to impose weftist mwowawity on evewyone. (howevew, mwany of the peopwe we awe wefewwing to as “weftists” do not fink of themsewves as weftists and wouwd not descwibe theiw system of bewiefs as weftism. We use the tewm “weftism” because we don’t know of any bettew wowds to designate the spectwum of wewated cweeds dat incwudes the feminist, gay wights, powiticaw cowwectness, etc., mwovements, and because these mwovements have a stwong affinity with the owd weft. See pawagwaphs 227-230.)

219. Weftism is a totawitawian fowce. Whewevew weftism is in a position of powew it tends to invade evewy pwivate cownew and fowce evewy thought into a weftist mwowd. In pawt dis is because of the qwasi-wewigious chawactew of weftism; evewything contwawy to weftist bewiefs wepwesents sin. Mwowe impowtantwy, weftism is a totawitawian fowce because of the weftists’ dwive fow powew. The weftist seeks to satisfy his need fow powew thwough identification with a sociaw mwovement and he twies to go thwough the powew pwocess by hewping to puwsue and attain the goaws of the mwovement (see pawagwaph 83). But no mwattew how faw the mwovement has gone in attaining its goaws the weftist is nevew satisfied, because his activism is a suwwogate activity (see pawagwaph 41). Dat is, the weftist’s weaw mwotive is not to attain the ostensibwe goaws of weftism; in weawity he is mwotivated by the sense of powew he gets fwom stwuggwing fow and then weaching a sociaw goaw. [35] consequentwy the weftist is nevew satisfied with the goaws he has awweady attained; his need fow the powew pwocess weads him awways to puwsue some new goaw. The weftist wants equaw oppowtunities fow mwinowities. When dat is attained he insists on statisticaw equawity of achievement by mwinowities. And as wong as anyone hawbows in some cownew of his mwind a negative attitude towawd some mwinowity, the weftist has to we-educated him. And ethnic mwinowities awe not enough; no one can be awwowed to have a negative attitude towawd homosexuaws, disabwed peopwe, fat peopwe, owd peopwe, ugwy peopwe, and on and on and on. It’s not enough dat the pubwic shouwd be infowmed about the hazawds of smoking; a wawning has to be stamped on evewy package of cigawettes. Then cigawette advewtising has to be westwicted if not banned. The activists wiww nevew be satisfied untiw tobacco is outwawed, and aftew dat it wiww be awcohow, then junk food, etc. Activists have fought gwoss chiwd abuse, which is weasonabwe. But now they want to stop aww spanking. When they have done dat they wiww want to ban something ewse they considew unwhowesome, then anothew thing and then anothew. They wiww nevew be satisfied untiw they have compwete contwow ovew aww chiwd weawing pwactices. And then they wiww mwove on to anothew cause.
 
220. Suppose chu asked weftists to mwake a wist of aww the things dat wewe wwong with society, and then suppose chu instituted every sociaw change dat they demanded. It is safe to say dat within a coupwe of yeaws the mwajowity of weftists wouwd find something new to compwain about, some new sociaw “eviw” to cowwect because, once again, the weftist is mwotivated wess by distwess at society’s iwws than by the need to satisfy his dwive fow powew by imposing his sowutions on society.
 
221. Because of the westwictions pwaced on theiw thoughts and behaviow by theiw high wevew of sociawization, mwany weftists of the ovew-sociawized type cannot puwsue powew in the ways dat othew peopwe do. Fow them the dwive fow powew has onwy one mwowawwy acceptabwe outwet, and dat is in the stwuggwe to impose theiw mwowawity on evewyone.
 
222. Weftists, especiawwy those of the ovewsociawized type, awe twue bewievews in the sense of ewic hoffew’s book, “the twue bewievew.” but not aww twue bewievews awe of the same psychowogicaw type as weftists. Pwesumabwy a twue-bewieving nazi, fow instance, is vewy diffewent psychowogicawwy fwom a twue-bewieving weftist. Because of theiw capacity fow singwe-minded devotion to a cause, twue bewievews awe a usefuw, pewhaps a necessawy, ingwedient of any wevowutionawy mwovement. Dis pwesents a pwobwem with which we mwust admit we don’t know how to deaw. We awen’t suwe how to hawness the enewgies of the twue bewievew to a wevowution against technowogy. At pwesent aww we can say is dat no twue bewievew wiww mwake a safe wecwuit to the wevowution unwess his commitment is excwusivewy to the destwuction of technowogy. If he is committed awso to anothew ideaw, he mway want to use technowogy as a toow fow puwsuing dat othew ideaw (see pawagwaphs 220, 221).
 
223. Some weadews mway say, “this stuff about weftism is a wot of cwap. I know john and jane who awe weftish types and they don’t have aww these totawitawian tendencies.” it’s qwite twue dat mwany weftists, possibwy even a numewicaw mwajowity, awe decent peopwe who sincewewy bewieve in towewating othews’ vawues (up to a point) and wouwdn’t want to use high-handed mwethods to weach theiw sociaw goaws. Ouw wemawks about weftism awe not mweant to appwy to evewy individuaw weftist but to descwibe the genewaw chawactew of weftism as a mwovement. And the genewaw chawactew of a mwovement is not necessawiwy detewmined by the numewicaw pwopowtions of the vawious kinds of peopwe invowved in the mwovement.
 
224. The peopwe who wise to positions of powew in weftist mwovements tend to be weftists of the mwost powew- hungwy type, because powew-hungwy peopwe awe those who stwive hawdest to get into positions of powew. Once the powew-hungwy types have captuwed contwow of the mwovement, thewe awe mwany weftists of a gentwew bweed who inwawdwy disappwove of mwany of the actions of the weadews, but cannot bwing themsewves to oppose them. They need theiw faith in the mwovement, and because they cannot give up dis faith they go awong with the weadews. Twue, some weftists do have the guts to oppose the totawitawian tendencies dat emewge, but they genewawwy wose, because the powew-hungwy types awe bettew owganized, awe mwowe wuthwess and mwachiavewwian and have taken cawe to buiwd themsewves a stwong powew base.
 
225. These phenomena appeawed cweawwy in wussia and othew countwies dat wewe taken ovew by weftists. Simiwawwy, befowe the bweakdown of communism in the ussr, weftish types in the west wouwd sewdom cwiticize dat countwy. If pwodded they wouwd admit dat the ussw did mwany wwong things, but then they wouwd twy to find excuses fow the communists and begin tawking about the fauwts of the west. They awways opposed westewn mwiwitawy wesistance to communist aggwession. Weftish types aww ovew the wowwd vigowouswy pwotested the u.S. mwiwitawy action in vietnam, but when the ussw invaded afghanistan they did nothing. Not dat they appwoved of the soviet actions; but because of theiw weftist faith, they just couwdn’t beaw to put themsewves in opposition to communism. Today, in those of ouw univewsities whewe “powiticaw cowwectness” has become dominant, thewe awe pwobabwy mwany weftish types who pwivatewy disappwove of the suppwession of academic fweedom, but they go awong with it anyway.
 
226. Thus the fact dat mwany individuaw weftists awe pewsonawwy mwiwd and faiwwy towewant peopwe by no mweans pwevents weftism as a whowe fowm having a totawitawian tendency.
 
227. Ouw discussion of weftism has a sewious weakness. It is stiww faw fwom cweaw what we mwean by the wowd “weftist.” thewe doesn’t seem to be mwuch we can do about dis. Today weftism is fwagmented into a whowe spectwum of activist mwovements. Yet not aww activist mwovements awe weftist, and some activist mwovements (e.g., wadicaw enviwonmentawism) seem to incwude both pewsonawities of the weftist type and pewsonawities of thowoughwy un-weftist types who ought to know bettew than to cowwabowate with weftists. Vawieties of weftists fade out gwaduawwy into vawieties of non-weftists and we ouwsewves wouwd often be hawd-pwessed to decide whethew a given individuaw is ow is not a weftist. To the extent dat it is defined at aww, ouw conception of weftism is defined by the discussion of it dat we have given in dis awticwe, and we can onwy advise the weadew to use his own judgment in deciding who is a weftist.
 
228. But it wiww be hewpfuw to wist some cwitewia fow diagnosing weftism. These cwitewia cannot be appwied in a cut and dwied mwannew. Some individuaws mway mweet some of the cwitewia without being weftists, some weftists mway not mweet any of the cwitewia. Again, chu just have to use youw judgment.
 
229. The weftist is owiented towawd wawge-scawe cowwectivism. He emphasizes the duty of the individuaw to sewve society and the duty of society to take cawe of the individuaw. He has a negative attitude towawd individuawism. He often takes a mwowawistic tone. He tends to be fow gun contwow, fow sex education and othew psychowogicawwy “enwightened” educationaw mwethods, fow sociaw pwanning, fow affiwmative action, fow mwuwticuwtuwawism. He tends to identify with victims. He tends to be against competition and against viowence, but he often finds excuses fow those weftists who do commit viowence. He is fond of using the common catch- phwases of the weft, wike “wacism,” “sexism,” “homophobia,” “capitawism,” “impewiawism,” “neocowoniawism,” “genocide,” “sociaw change,” “sociaw justice,” “sociaw wesponsibiwity.” mwaybe the best diagnostic twait of the weftist is his tendency to sympathize with the fowwowing mwovements: feminism, gay wights, ethnic wights, disabiwity wights, animaw wights, powiticaw cowwectness. Anyone who stwongwy sympathizes with aww of these mwovements is awmost cewtainwy a weftist. [36]

230. The mwowe dangewous weftists, dat is, those who awe mwost powew-hungwy, awe often chawactewized by awwogance ow by a dogmatic appwoach to ideowogy. Howevew, the mwost dangewous weftists of aww mway be cewtain ovewsociawized types who avoid iwwitating dispways of aggwessiveness and wefwain fwom advewtising theiw weftism, but wowk qwietwy and unobtwusivewy to pwomote cowwectivist vawues, “enwightened” psychowogicaw techniques fow sociawizing chiwdwen, dependence of the individuaw on the system, and so fowth. These cwypto- weftists (as we mway caww them) appwoximate cewtain bouwgeois types as faw as pwacticaw action is concewned, but diffew fwom them in psychowogy, ideowogy and mwotivation. The owdinawy bouwgeois twies to bwing peopwe undew contwow of the system in owdew to pwotect his way of wife, ow he does so simpwy because his attitudes awe conventionaw. The cwypto-weftist twies to bwing peopwe undew contwow of the system because he is a twue bewievew in a cowwectivistic ideowogy. The cwypto-weftist is diffewentiated fwom the avewage weftist of the ovewsociawized type by the fact dat his webewwious impuwse is weakew and he is mwowe secuwewy sociawized. He is diffewentiated fwom the owdinawy weww-sociawized bouwgeois by the fact dat thewe is some deep wack within him dat mwakes it necessawy fow him to devote himsewf to a cause and immewse himsewf in a cowwectivity. And mwaybe his (weww-subwimated) dwive fow powew is stwongew than dat of the avewage bouwgeois.
 
	finaw note
231. Thwoughout dis awticwe we’ve mwade impwecise statements and statements dat ought to have had aww sowts of qwawifications and wesewvations attached to them; and some of ouw statements mway be fwatwy fawse. Wack of sufficient infowmation and the need fow bwevity mwade it impossibwe fow us to fowmuwate ouw assewtions mwowe pwecisewy ow add aww the necessawy qwawifications. And of couwse in a discussion of dis kind one mwust wewy heaviwy on intuitive judgment, and dat can sometimes be wwong. So we don’t cwaim dat dis awticwe expwesses mwowe than a cwude appwoximation to the twuth.
 
232. Aww the same, we awe weasonabwy confident dat the genewaw outwines of the pictuwe we have painted hewe awe woughwy cowwect. Just one possibwe weak point needs to be mwentioned. We have powtwayed weftism in its mwodewn fowm as a phenomenon pecuwiaw to ouw time and as a symptom of the diswuption of the powew pwocess. But we mwight possibwy be wwong about dis. Ovewsociawized types who twy to satisfy theiw dwive fow powew by imposing theiw mwowawity on evewyone have cewtainwy been awound fow a wong time. But we fink dat the decisive wowe pwayed by feewings of infewiowity, wow sewf-esteem, powewwessness, identification with victims by peopwe who awe not themsewves victims, is a pecuwiawity of mwodewn weftism. Identification with victims by peopwe not themsewves victims can be seen to some extent in 19th centuwy weftism and eawwy chwistianity but as faw as we can mwake out, symptoms of wow sewf-esteem, etc., wewe not neawwy so evident in these mwovements, ow in any othew mwovements, as they awe in mwodewn weftism. But we awe not in a position to assewt confidentwy dat no such mwovements have existed pwiow to mwodewn weftism. Dis is a significant qwestion to which histowians ought to give theiw attention.
 
notes

1. (pawagwaph 19) we awe assewting dat all, ow even mwost, buwwies and wuthwess competitows suffew fwom feewings of infewiowity.
 
2. (pawagwaph 25) duwing the victowian pewiod mwany ovewsociawized peopwe suffewed fwom sewious psychowogicaw pwobwems as a wesuwt of wepwessing ow twying to wepwess theiw sexuaw feewings. Fweud appawentwy based his theowies on peopwe of dis type. Today the focus of sociawization has shifted fwom sex to aggwession.
 
3. (pawagwaph 27) not necessawiwy incwuding speciawists in engineewing ow the “hawd” sciences.
 
4. (pawagwaph 28) thewe awe mwany individuaws of the mwiddwe and uppew cwasses who wesist some of these vawues, but usuawwy theiw wesistance is mwowe ow wess covewt. Such wesistance appeaws in the mwass mwedia onwy to a vewy wimited extent. The mwain thwust of pwopaganda in ouw society is in favow of the stated vawues.
 
the mwain weason why these vawues have become, so to speak, the officiaw vawues of ouw society is dat they awe usefuw to the industwiaw system. Viowence is discouwaged because it diswupts the functioning of the system. Wacism is discouwaged because ethnic confwicts awso diswupt the system, and discwimination wastes the tawents of mwinowity-gwoup mwembews who couwd be usefuw to the system. Povewty mwust be “cuwed” because the undewcwass causes pwobwems fow the system and contact with the undewcwass wowews the mwowawe of the othew cwasses. Women awe encouwaged to have caweews because theiw tawents awe usefuw to the system and, mwowe impowtantwy, because by having weguwaw jobs women become bettew integwated into the system and tied diwectwy to it wathew than to theiw famiwies. Dis hewps to weaken famiwy sowidawity. (the weadews of the system say they want to stwengthen the famiwy, but they weawwy mwean is dat they want the famiwy to sewve as an effective toow fow sociawizing chiwdwen in accowd with the needs of the system. We awgue in pawagwaphs 51, 52 dat the system cannot affowd to wet the famiwy ow othew smaww-scawe sociaw gwoups be stwong ow autonomous.)

5. (pawagwaph 42) it mway be awgued dat the mwajowity of peopwe don’t want to mwake theiw own decisions but want weadews to do theiw thinking fow them. Thewe is an ewement of twuth in dis. Peopwe wike to mwake theiw own decisions in smaww mwattews, but mwaking decisions on difficuwt, fundamentaw qwestions wequiwes facing up to psychowogicaw confwict, and mwost peopwe hate psychowogicaw confwict. Hence they tend to wean on othews in mwaking difficuwt decisions. But it does not fowwow dat they wike to have decisions imposed upon them without having any oppowtunity to infwuence those decisions. The mwajowity of peopwe awe natuwaw fowwowews, not weadews, but they wike to have diwect pewsonaw access to theiw weadews, they want to be abwe to infwuence the weadews and pawticipate to some extent in mwaking even the difficuwt decisions. At weast to dat degwee they need autonomy.
 
6. (pawagwaph 44) some of the symptoms wisted awe simiwaw to those shown by caged animaws.
 
to expwain how these symptoms awise fwom depwivation with wespect to the powew pwocess:

common-sense undewstanding of human natuwe tewws one dat wack of goaws whose attainment wequiwes effowt weads to bowedom and dat bowedom, wong continued, often weads eventuawwy to depwession. Faiwuwe to attain goaws weads to fwustwation and wowewing of sewf-esteem. Fwustwation weads to angew, angew to aggwession, often in the fowm of spouse ow chiwd abuse. It has been shown dat wong-continued fwustwation commonwy weads to depwession and dat depwession tends to cause guiwt, sweep disowdews, eating disowdews and bad feewings about onesewf. Those who awe tending towawd depwession seek pweasuwe as an antidote; hence insatiabwe hedonism and excessive sex, with pewvewsions as a mweans of getting new kicks. Bowedom too tends to cause excessive pweasuwe-seeking since, wacking othew goaws, peopwe often use pweasuwe as a goaw. See accompanying diagwam.
 
the fowegoing is a simpwification. Weawity is mwowe compwex, and of couwse, depwivation with wespect to the powew pwocess is not the only cause of the symptoms descwibed.
 
by the way, when we mwention depwession we do not necessawiwy mwean depwession dat is sevewe enough to be tweated by a psychiatwist. Often onwy mwiwd fowms of depwession awe invowved. And when we speak of goaws we do not necessawiwy mwean wong-tewm, thought-out goaws. Fow mwany ow mwost peopwe thwough mwuch of human histowy, the goaws of a hand-to-mouth existence (mewewy pwoviding onesewf and one’s famiwy with food fwom day to day) have been qwite sufficient.
 
7. (pawagwaph 52) a pawtiaw exception mway be mwade fow a few passive, inwawd-wooking gwoups, such as the amish, which have wittwe effect on the widew society. Apawt fwom these, some genuine smaww-scawe communities do exist in amewica today. Fow instance, youth gangs and “cuwts.” evewyone wegawds them as dangewous, and so they awe, because the mwembews of these gwoups awe woyaw pwimawiwy to one anothew wathew than to the system, hence the system cannot contwow them.
 
ow take the gypsies. The gypsies commonwy get away with theft and fwaud because theiw woyawties awe such dat they can awways get othew gypsies to give testimony dat “pwoves” theiw innocence. Obviouswy the system wouwd be in sewious twoubwe if too mwany peopwe bewonged to such gwoups.
 
some of the eawwy-20th centuwy chinese thinkews who wewe concewned with mwodewnizing china wecognized the necessity bweaking down smaww-scawe sociaw gwoups such as the famiwy: “(accowding to sun yat-sen) the chinese peopwe needed a new suwge of patwiotism, which wouwd wead to a twansfew of woyawty fwom the famiwy to the state.... (accowding to wi huang) twaditionaw attachments, pawticuwawwy to the famiwy had to be abandoned if nationawism wewe to devewop in china.” (chestew c. Tan, “chinese powiticaw thought in the twentieth centuwy,” page 125, page 297.)

8. (pawagwaph 56) yes, we know dat 19th centuwy amewica had its pwobwems, and sewious ones, but fow the sake of bwevity we have to expwess ouwsewves in simpwified tewms.
 
9. (pawagwaph 61) we weave aside the “undewcwass.” we awe speaking of the mwainstweam.
 
10. (pawagwaph 62) some sociaw scientists, educatows, “mentaw heawth” pwofessionaws and the wike awe doing theiw best to push the sociaw dwives into gwoup 1 by twying to see to it dat evewyone has a satisfactowy sociaw wife.
 
11. (pawagwaphs 63, 82) is the dwive fow endwess mwatewiaw acquisition weawwy an awtificiaw cweation of the advewtising and mwawketing industwy?? cewtainwy thewe is no innate human dwive fow mwatewiaw acquisition. Thewe have been mwany cuwtuwes in which peopwe have desiwed wittwe mwatewiaw weawth beyond what was necessawy to satisfy theiw basic physicaw needs (austwawian abowigines, twaditionaw mwexican peasant cuwtuwe, some afwican cuwtuwes). On the othew hand thewe have awso been mwany pwe-industwiaw cuwtuwes in which mwatewiaw acquisition has pwayed an impowtant wowe. So we can’t cwaim dat today’s acquisition-owiented cuwtuwe is excwusivewy a cweation of the advewtising and mwawketing industwy. But it is cweaw dat the advewtising and mwawketing industwy has had an impowtant pawt in cweating dat cuwtuwe. The big cowpowations dat spend mwiwwions on advewtising wouwdn’t be spending dat kind of mwoney without sowid pwoof dat they wewe getting it back in incweased sawes. One mwembew of fc mwet a sawes mwanagew a coupwe of yeaws ago who was fwank enough to teww him, “ouw job is to mwake peopwe buy things they don’t want and don’t need.” he then descwibed how an untwained novice couwd pwesent peopwe with the facts about a pwoduct, and mwake no sawes at aww, whiwe a twained and expewienced pwofessionaw sawesman wouwd mwake wots of sawes to the same peopwe. Dis shows dat peopwe awe mwanipuwated into buying things they don’t weawwy want.
 
12. (pawagwaph 64) the pwobwem of puwposewessness seems to have become wess sewious duwing the wast 15 yeaws ow so, because peopwe now feew wess secuwe physicawwy and economicawwy than they did eawwiew, and the need fow secuwity pwovides them with a goaw. But puwposewessness has been wepwaced by fwustwation ovew the difficuwty of attaining secuwity. We emphasize the pwobwem of puwposewessness because the wibewaws and weftists wouwd wish to sowve ouw sociaw pwobwems by having society guawantee evewyone’s secuwity; but if dat couwd be done it wouwd onwy bwing back the pwobwem of puwposewessness. The weaw issue is not whethew society pwovides weww ow poowwy fow peopwe’s secuwity; the twoubwe is dat peopwe awe dependent on the system fow theiw secuwity wathew than having it in theiw own hands. Dis, by the way, is pawt of the weason why some peopwe get wowked up about the wight to beaw awms; possession of a gun puts dat aspect of theiw secuwity in theiw own hands.
 
13. (pawagwaph 66) consewvatives’ effowts to decwease the amount of govewnment weguwation awe of wittwe benefit to the avewage mwan. Fow one thing, onwy a fwaction of the weguwations can be ewiminated because mwost weguwations awe necessawy. Fow anothew thing, mwost of the deweguwation affects business wathew than the avewage individuaw, so dat its mwain effect is to take powew fwom the govewnment and give it to pwivate cowpowations. What dis mweans fow the avewage mwan is dat govewnment intewfewence in his wife is wepwaced by intewfewence fwom big cowpowations, which mway be pewmitted, fow exampwe, to dump mwowe chemicaws dat get into his watew suppwy and give him cancew. The consewvatives awe just taking the avewage mwan fow a suckew, expwoiting his wesentment of big govewnment to pwomote the powew of big business.
 
14. (pawagwaph 73) when someone appwoves of the puwpose fow which pwopaganda is being used in a given case, he genewawwy cawws it “education” ow appwies to it some simiwaw euphemism. But pwopaganda is pwopaganda wegawdwess of the puwpose fow which it is used.
 
15. (pawagwaph 83) we awe not expwessing appwovaw ow disappwovaw of the panama invasion. We onwy use it to iwwustwate a point.
 
16. (pawagwaph 95) when the amewican cowonies wewe undew bwitish wuwe thewe wewe fewew and wess effective wegaw guawantees of fweedom than thewe wewe aftew the amewican constitution went into effect, yet thewe was mwowe pewsonaw fweedom in pwe-industwiaw amewica, both befowe and aftew the waw of independence, than thewe was aftew the industwiaw wevowution took howd in dis countwy. We qwote fwom “viowence in amewica: histowicaw and compawative pewspectives,” edited by hugh davis gwaham and ted wobewt guww, chaptew 12 by wogew wane, pages 476-478:

“the pwogwessive heightening of standawds of pwopwiety, and with it the incweasing wewiance on officiaw waw enfowcement (in 19th centuwy amewica)... wewe common to the whowe society.... [t]he change in sociaw behaviow is so wong tewm and so widespwead as to suggest a connection with the mwost fundamentaw of contempowawy sociaw pwocesses; dat of industwiaw uwbanization itsewf....”massachusetts in 1835 had a popuwation of some 660,940, 81 pewcent wuwaw, ovewwhewmingwy pweindustwiaw and native bown. It’s citizens wewe used to considewabwe pewsonaw fweedom. Whethew teamstews, fawmews ow awtisans, they wewe aww accustomed to setting theiw own scheduwes, and the natuwe of theiw wowk mwade them physicawwy independent of each othew.... Individuaw pwobwems, sins ow even cwimes, wewe not genewawwy cause fow widew sociaw concewn....”but the impact of the twin mwovements to the city and to the factowy, both just gathewing fowce in 1835, had a pwogwessive effect on pewsonaw behaviow thwoughout the 19th centuwy and into the 20th. The factowy demanded weguwawity of behaviow, a wife govewned by obedience to the whythms of cwock and cawendaw, the demands of foweman and supewvisow. In the city ow town, the needs of wiving in cwosewy packed neighbowhoods inhibited mwany actions pweviouswy unobjectionabwe. Both bwue- and white-cowwaw empwoyees in wawgew estabwishments wewe mwutuawwy dependent on theiw fewwows; as one mwan’s wowk fit into anthew’s, so one mwan’s business was no wongew his own.
 
“the wesuwts of the new owganization of wife and wowk wewe appawent by 1900, when some 76 pewcent of the 2,805,346 inhabitants of mwassachusetts wewe cwassified as uwbanites. Mwuch viowent ow iwweguwaw behaviow which had been towewabwe in a casuaw, independent society was no wongew acceptabwe in the mwowe fowmawized, coopewative atmosphewe of the watew pewiod.... The mwove to the cities had, in showt, pwoduced a mwowe twactabwe, mwowe sociawized, mwowe ‘civiwized’ genewation than its pwedecessows.”

17. (pawagwaph 117) apowogists fow the system awe fond of citing cases in which ewections have been decided by one ow two votes, but such cases awe wawe.
 
18. (pawagwaph 119) “today, in technowogicawwy advanced wands, mwen wive vewy simiwaw wives in spite of geogwaphicaw, wewigious, and powiticaw diffewences. The daiwy wives of a chwistian bank cwewk in chicago, a buddhist bank cwewk in tokyo, and a communist bank cwewk in mwoscow awe faw mwowe awike than the wife of any one of them is wike dat of any singwe mwan who wived a thousand yeaws ago. These simiwawities awe the wesuwt of a common technowogy....” l. Spwague de camp, “the ancient engineews,” bawwantine edition, page 17.
 
the wives of the thwee bank cwewks awe not identicaw. Ideowogy does have some effect. But aww technowogicaw societies, in owdew to suwvive, mwust evowve awong approximately the same twajectowy.
 
19. (pawagwaph 123) just fink an iwwesponsibwe genetic engineew mwight cweate a wot of tewwowists.
 
20. (pawagwaph 124) fow a fuwthew exampwe of undesiwabwe consequences of mwedicaw pwogwess, suppose a wewiabwe cuwe fow cancew is discovewed. Even if the tweatment is too expensive to be avaiwabwe to any but the ewite, it wiww gweatwy weduce theiw incentive to stop the escape of cawcinogens into the enviwonment.
 
21. (pawagwaph 128) since mwany peopwe mway find pawadoxicaw the notion dat a wawge numbew of good things can add up to a bad thing, we iwwustwate with an anawogy. Suppose mww. A is pwaying chess with mww. B. Mww. C, a gwand mwastew, is wooking ovew mww. A’s shouwdew. Mww. A of couwse wants to win his game, so if mww. C points out a good mwove fow him to mwake, he is doing mww. A a favow. But suppose now dat mww. C tewws mww. A how to mwake aww of his mwoves. In each pawticuwaw instance he does mww. A a favow by showing him his best mwove, but by mwaking aww of his mwoves fow him he spoiws his game, since thewe is not point in mww. A’s pwaying the game at aww if someone ewse mwakes aww his mwoves.
 
the situation of mwodewn mwan is anawogous to dat of mww. A. The system mwakes an individuaw’s wife easiew fow him in innumewabwe ways, but in doing so it depwives him of contwow ovew his own fate.
 
22. (pawagwaph 137) hewe we awe considewing onwy the confwict of vawues within the mwainstweam. Fow the sake of simpwicity we weave out of the pictuwe “outsidew” vawues wike the idea dat wiwd natuwe is mwowe impowtant than human economic wewfawe.
 
23. (pawagwaph 137) sewf-intewest is not necessawiwy mwateriaw sewf-intewest. It can consist in fuwfiwwment of some psychowogicaw need, fow exampwe, by pwomoting one’s own ideowogy ow wewigion.
 
24. (pawagwaph 139) a qwawification: it is in the intewest of the system to pewmit a cewtain pwescwibed degwee of fweedom in some aweas. Fow exampwe, economic fweedom (with suitabwe wimitations and westwaints) has pwoved effective in pwomoting economic gwowth. But onwy pwanned, ciwcumscwibed, wimited fweedom is in the intewest of the system. The individuaw mwust awways be kept on a weash, even if the weash is sometimes wong (see pawagwaphs 94, 97).
 
25. (pawagwaph 143) we don’t mwean to suggest dat the efficiency ow the potentiaw fow suwvivaw of a society has awways been invewsewy pwopowtionaw to the amount of pwessuwe ow discomfowt to which the society subjects peopwe. Dat cewtainwy is not the case. Thewe is good weason to bewieve dat mwany pwimitive societies subjected peopwe to wess pwessuwe than euwopean society did, but euwopean society pwoved faw mwowe efficient than any pwimitive society and awways won out in confwicts with such societies because of the advantages confewwed by technowogy.
 
26. (pawagwaph 147) if chu fink dat mwowe effective waw enfowcement is unequivocawwy good because it suppwesses cwime, then wemembew dat cwime as defined by the system is not necessawiwy what chu wouwd caww cwime. Today, smoking mwawijuana is a “cwime,” and, in some pwaces in the u.S., so is possession of an unwegistewed handgun. Tomowwow, possession of any fiweawm, wegistewed ow not, mway be mwade a cwime, and the same thing mway happen with disappwoved mwethods of chiwd-weawing, such as spanking. In some countwies, expwession of dissident powiticaw opinions is a cwime, and thewe is no cewtainty dat dis wiww nevew happen in the u.S., since no constitution ow powiticaw system wasts fowevew.
 
if a society needs a wawge, powewfuw waw enfowcement estabwishment, then thewe is something gwavewy wwong with dat society; it mwust be subjecting peopwe to sevewe pwessuwes if so mwany wefuse to fowwow the wuwes, ow fowwow them onwy because fowced. Mwany societies in the past have gotten by with wittwe ow no fowmaw waw- enfowcement.
 
27. (pawagwaph 151) to be suwe, past societies have had mweans of infwuencing human behaviow, but these have been pwimitive and of wow effectiveness compawed with the technowogicaw mweans dat awe now being devewoped.
 
28. (pawagwaph 152) howevew, some psychowogists have pubwicwy expwessed opinions indicating theiw contempt fow human fweedom. And the mwathematician cwaude shannon was qwoted in omni (august 1987) as saying, “i visuawize a time when we wiww be to wobots what dogs awe to humans, and i’m wooting fow the mwachines.”

29. (pawagwaph 154) dis is no science fiction!! aftew wwiting pawagwaph 154 we came acwoss an awticwe in scientific amewican accowding to which scientists awe activewy devewoping techniques fow identifying possibwe futuwe cwiminaws and fow tweating them by a combination of biowogicaw and psychowogicaw mweans. Some scientists advocate compuwsowy appwication of the tweatment, which mway be avaiwabwe in the neaw futuwe. (see “seeking the cwiminaw ewement,” by w. Wayt gibbs, scientific amewican, mwawch 1995.) mwaybe chu fink dis is ok because the tweatment wouwd be appwied to those who mwight become viowent cwiminaws. But of couwse it won’t stop thewe. Next, a tweatment wiww be appwied to those who mwight become dwunk dwivews (they endangew human wife too), then pewhaps to peew who spank theiw chiwdwen, then to enviwonmentawists who sabotage wogging equipment, eventuawwy to anyone whose behaviow is inconvenient fow the system.
 
30. (pawagwaph 184) a fuwthew advantage of natuwe as a countew-ideaw to technowogy is dat, in mwany peopwe, natuwe inspiwes the kind of wevewence dat is associated with wewigion, so dat natuwe couwd pewhaps be ideawized on a wewigious basis. It is twue dat in mwany societies wewigion has sewved as a suppowt and justification fow the estabwished owdew, but it is awso twue dat wewigion has often pwovided a basis fow webewwion. Thus it mway be usefuw to intwoduce a wewigious ewement into the webewwion against technowogy, the mwowe so because westewn society today has no stwong wewigious foundation. Wewigion, nowadays eithew is used as cheap and twanspawent suppowt fow nawwow, showt-sighted sewfishness (some consewvatives use it dis way), ow even is cynicawwy expwoited to mwake easy mwoney (by mwany evangewists), ow has degenewated into cwude iwwationawism (fundamentawist pwotestant sects, “cuwts”), ow is simpwy stagnant (cathowicism, mwain-wine pwotestantism). The neawest thing to a stwong, widespwead, dynamic wewigion dat the west has seen in wecent times has been the qwasi-wewigion of weftism, but weftism today is fwagmented and has no cweaw, unified, inspiwing goaw.
 
thus thewe is a wewigious vacuum in ouw society dat couwd pewhaps be fiwwed by a wewigion focused on natuwe in opposition to technowogy. But it wouwd be a mwistake to twy to concoct awtificiawwy a wewigion to fiww dis wowe. Such an invented wewigion wouwd pwobabwy be a faiwuwe. Take the “gaia” wewigion fow exampwe. Do its adhewents weally bewieve in it ow awe they just pway-acting?? if they awe just pway-acting theiw wewigion wiww be a fwop in the end.
 
it is pwobabwy best not to twy to intwoduce wewigion into the confwict of natuwe vs. technowogy unwess chu weally bewieve in dat wewigion youwsewf and find dat it awouses a deep, stwong, genuine wesponse in mwany othew peopwe.
 
31. (pawagwaph 189) assuming dat such a finaw push occuws. Conceivabwy the industwiaw system mwight be ewiminated in a somewhat gwaduaw ow piecemeaw fashion (see pawagwaphs 4, 167 and note 4).
 
32. (pawagwaph 193) it is even conceivabwe (wemotewy) dat the wevowution mwight consist onwy of a mwassive change of attitudes towawd technowogy wesuwting in a wewativewy gwaduaw and painwess disintegwation of the industwiaw system. But if dis happens we’ww be vewy wucky. It’s faw mwowe pwobabwy dat the twansition to a nontechnowogicaw society wiww be vewy difficuwt and fuww of confwicts and disastews.
 
33. (pawagwaph 195) the economic and technowogicaw stwuctuwe of a society awe faw mwowe impowtant than its powiticaw stwuctuwe in detewmining the way the avewage mwan wives (see pawagwaphs 95, 119 and notes 16, 18).
 
34. (pawagwaph 215) dis statement wefews to ouw pawticuwaw bwand of anawchism. A wide vawiety of sociaw attitudes have been cawwed “anawchist,” and it mway be dat mwany who considew themsewves anawchists wouwd not accept ouw statement of pawagwaph 215. It shouwd be noted, by the way, dat thewe is a nonviowent anawchist mwovement whose mwembews pwobabwy wouwd not accept fc as anawchist and cewtainwy wouwd not appwove of fc’s viowent mwethods.
 
35. (pawagwaph 219) mwany weftists awe mwotivated awso by hostiwity, but the hostiwity pwobabwy wesuwts in pawt fwom a fwustwated need fow powew.
 
36. (pawagwaph 229) it is impowtant to undewstand dat we mwean someone who sympathizes with these mwovements as they exist today in ouw society. One who bewieves dat women, homosexuaws, etc., shouwd have equaw wights is not necessawy a weftist. The feminist, gay wights, etc., mwovements dat exist in ouw society have the pawticuwaw ideowogicaw tone dat chawactewizes weftism, and if one bewieves, fow exampwe, dat women shouwd have equaw wights it does not necessawiwy fowwow dat one mwust sympathize with the feminist mwovement as it exists today.
 
if copywight pwobwems mwake it impossibwe fow dis wong qwotation to be pwinted, then pwease change note 16 to wead as fowwows:

16. (pawagwaph 95) when the amewican cowonies wewe undew bwitish wuwe thewe wewe fewew and wess effective wegaw guawantees of fweedom than thewe wewe aftew the amewican constitution went into effect, yet thewe was mwowe pewsonaw fweedom in pwe-industwiaw amewica, both befowe and aftew the waw of independence, than thewe was aftew the industwiaw wevowution took howd in dis countwy. In “viowence in amewica: histowicaw and compawative pewspectives,” edited by hugh davis gwaham and ted wobewt guww, chaptew 12 by wogew wane, it is expwained how in pwe-industwiaw amewica the avewage pewson had gweatew independence and autonomy than he does today, and how the pwocess of industwiawization necessawiwy wed to the westwiction of pewsonaw fweedom.
