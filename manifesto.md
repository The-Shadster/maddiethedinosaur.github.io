### Property

What is property? Property can be best defined as the right to "use and abuse" land, buildings, etc. Will property exist under communism, in the means of production, land, etc? No, property will not exist under communism. This, however, does not mean I am allowed to take your home, toothbrush, etc. On the contrary, your home, toothbrush, etc, are guaranteed, not because you have a right to the ownership of property, but because you require these things to live.
