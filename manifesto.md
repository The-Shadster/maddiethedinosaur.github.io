## Section 3: Views and Aims

### Views
#### For
1. **Pro-Internationalism**:

History has proven that the revolution must be international or it is nothing. For example, the Russian Revolution failed, not because of vanguardism, but due to its isolation to a single country.

2. **Pro-Centralization**:

We support the centralization of production, not under the state, but under the whole of the human species. Everyone would have access to the total of production and thus posesses the freedom in deciding how to use it.

3. **Pro-Proletarian Dictatorship**:

The proletarian dictatorship is a necessary step in the establishment of communist society. Historically, the dictatorship has been exercised through the soviets (regional organizations of instantly recallable delegates 

4. **Pro-Party**:

The revolutionary communist party is a requirement for the proletarian revolution to suceed. Its tasks are the unification of workers' struggles, providing the proletariat with a revolutionary communist programme, and the defence of the revolution against all forces of reaction.

5. **Pro-Revolution**:

A violent proletarian revolution is necessary for the overthrow of the bourgeois state and the establishment of a proletarian class dictatorship.

#### Against
1. **Anti-Capitalism**:

The Internationalist Communist League is opposed to capitalism in all forms, whether worker managed, state managed or privately managed. Capitalism is not a system of management but a mode of production. 

2. **Anti-Work**:

Work is not labour, work is the division of labour and aliented labour. We strive for the abolition of work, and of coercion to labour.
